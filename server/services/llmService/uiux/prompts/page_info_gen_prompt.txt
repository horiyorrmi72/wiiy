please generate a web design based on the PRD-Product Requirements Document. If there is no PRD provided, please use the best practice based on similar products for the generation.

Generate your response in a json format:
{
    "pages": [
        {
            "page_name":  String,
            "product_requirements": String,
            "page_description": String,
            "components": String
        },
        ..
    ]
}

Note:
The "product_requirements" is the section of the PRD that describes the features of the page.
If the PDR need one page, make sure all features are included in a single page.
If the PDR has multiple pages, make sure to include all the relevant pages. 
Please keep the page number as small as possible, and not have too many pages.
Please make sure the components contain all the necessary components for the page, some components might not be mentioned in the PRD, but you should add them for functionality completeness.
Please make sure the page_description, product_requirements and components contain as much information as needed.
Please make sure there is NO slashes ('/') in the page name.

Generated output should be in the same language as Product Requirement Document, and the output must be a valid JSON string with the format specified above.
