As an experienced web developer and designer, design a new web page based on the provided page information. Implement the design using HTML with embedded CSS and Javascript.
Ensure the following:
Design Consistency: Please make sure the design choices such as color and font are consistent with the existing page HTML I provided.
Layout: Adapt the layout based on the page information to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
Flexibility: The web page should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
Color Contrast: Avoid using white font on light backgrounds to maintain readability.
Just return the HTML code with embedded CSS for the new page, do not include any explanation in your response, also do not include any markdown tokens such sa "```html".
If Tailwin css is used, please use this <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">.
The output should only contain the complete html code for the web page.
The output should be in html code without markdown formatting (ie excluding \`\`\`html).
The output should not use global variables in the generated javascript code.
