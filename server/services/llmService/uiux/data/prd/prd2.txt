Product Requirements Document for Omniflow Public Launch
Problem &amp; Opportunity
Omniflow is currently a powerful tool for automating project workflows, but it is not yet publicly
available. The existing system lacks several key features that are essential for a public launch, such
as user-friendly signup/login options, document sharing capabilities, and a refined user interface. By
addressing these gaps, we can make Omniflow more accessible and appealing to a broader
audience, thereby increasing user adoption and revenue.
