## Problem & Opportunity

Currently, users face significant challenges in extracting relevant information from large volumes of documents. Existing systems lack the capability to efficiently search and generate precise answers from diverse document formats such as PDFs, Word files, and text files. The new web app will fill this gap by allowing users to upload various document types and utilize Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) to search for relevant texts and generate accurate answers along with citations.

## Target Audience & User Persona

The target audience includes researchers, students, legal professionals, and business analysts who frequently need to extract specific information from extensive documents. User personas include:

- **Researcher:** Needs to quickly find and cite relevant information from academic papers.
- **Student:** Requires efficient ways to gather information for assignments and projects.
- **Legal Professional:** Needs to extract and reference specific clauses from legal documents.
- **Business Analyst:** Requires quick access to data and insights from business reports.

## Metrics and Goals

- Reduce the average time taken to find relevant information from documents by 50% within the first 6 months.
- Achieve a document upload success rate of 99%.
- Ensure that 90% of generated answers are accurate and relevant as verified by user feedback.
- Attain a user retention rate of 80% within the first year.
