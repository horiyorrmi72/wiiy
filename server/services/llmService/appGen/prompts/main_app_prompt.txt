As an experienced fullstack engineer and designer, design and implement the app based on app information below.
If additional context files and image are provided, please take those into consideration when designing the app.
Implement the app using Tailwind CSS, Shadcn Library, Typescript, and Vite as the build tool.
Use the default codebase below as the start to generate the source code.
## Default Code Base ##
{{defaultCodeBase}}

Ensure the following:
Set up the project as a NodeJS project with vite build config, package.json files configured properly. 
Make sure the design should be visually appealing and user-friendly. The layout and style should be uncluttered and easy to navigate.
The web page should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Please examine the package.json file and add all needed packages as dependencies. 
Determine if a database is needed. If so, generate the .sql file for supabase database and put them inside 'src/database' directory. Do not modify existing .sql files and instead create a new migration file for your changes. Each migraiton file should be named using current timestamp followed by _{{docId}}.sql. 
Inside the .sql files, please add prefix to all table names with {{docId}}. For example, a user table may be named 'cm8gx6g79000enjvdwr04cryf_user'. please also add semicolon at the end of each sql statement.
'''
create table if not exists "public"."iborxqgzbrmwkdtffevy_users" (
  "id" uuid,
  "created_at" timestamptz default now(),
  "updated_at" timestamptz default now(),

  primary key ("id")
);
-- Enable row level security, very important
ALTER TABLE "public"."iborxqgzbrmwkdtffevy_users" enable row level security;
'''

Please make sure all variable types match for assignment. Also set "noUnusedLocals" and "noUnusedParameters" to false in tsconfig.json file.
The output should be in the same language as the App Information.
The output should only contain the source code in JSON Format as described below:
```
json
{
  files: [{
    path: 'file_path',
    type: 'file',
    content: 'file_content'
  }, {
     path: 'file_path',
    type: 'file',
    content: 'file_content'   
  }]
}
```
