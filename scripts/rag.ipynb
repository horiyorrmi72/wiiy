      "['Product Requirements Document\\n\\nProblem & Opportunity\\n\\nThe current user management system in Project Willy is limited to email/password login and lacks support for OAuth-based authentication methods like Google OAuth. Additionally, the existing system does not provide a comprehensive way for users to join different teams through invitations, nor does it allow team admins to manage team members effectively.

The only user information stored in Cognito will be email and security information.\\nEverything else will be stored in our own User table:\\na. userId - reference to the ID from Cognito\\nb. Email - leaving this so we can search in future (but it is double-stored with\\nCognito)\\nc. userName\\nd. firstName\\ne. lastName\\nf. Specialty\\ng. Picture - eventually\\n2. Only email is required to add the user to Cognito. When the user logs in, if they have not\\nfilled in the rest of the information, they will be required to do so in order to continue.\\n3. When you invite a new user from the UI, we will generate a new Cognito account with\\njust their email and a temporary password. We will customize the email they receive to\\nindicate next steps. They will need to login from there.\\na. If the user already exists but in another organization we will need to invite them to\\njoin the new one. This is a flow that will need to be worked out\\n4. I am suggesting we leave the sign-up form turned off on the site for now, but we can turn\\nthis on later with an invitation code (or open to the public when we get there).\\nRealistically this would be more about starting a new organization than signing up a new\\nuser within one, so I think the flow will be a bit different here.\\n5. We will update the Users model in our system to not store any of the information from\\nCognito. This means removing the following fields: password.\\n6. If in future we want to move more data into Cognito, we can do so and keep our\\nserver-side APIs the same (the server can talk to Cognito if needed)\\n\\nOrganizations and Teams\\n1. Organizations will represent the top level(s) of our projects/users tree. A user can belong\\nto more than one organization, but projects cannot\\n2. We will have a new model to represent users in an organization, called OrganizationUser\\n\\n\\x0ca. id - unique id for this user/organization combo. This is what we will reference\\nfrom projects, etc.\\nb. cognitoUserId - same as Cognito - we will use this when we need to look up\\ninformation from Cognito or send emails\\nc. organizationId - link to Organization model / table\\nd. department\\ne. Role - refers to the user’s role at the organization level - for example ADMIN\\nmeans they administer the organization and can do things like changing tiers.\\nTeam roles are treated separately (see below)\\nf. Velocity\\ng. Status - lets us disable a user within an organization while preserving history\\n7. Within an organization, we will have a tree of Teams. Each team can contain other\\nsub-teams and projects. The Team and UserTeam models will be changed as follows:\\na. Add a parentTeamId field to the Team model. This field can be null, and will\\ndetermine where the team fits in the tree. If the parent is null, it will be a direct\\nchild of the organization\\nb. The userId field in UserTeam will be changed to point to the OrganizationUser\\nmodel\\nc. Add a role to the UserTeam table to indicate the user’s role within that team. We\\nwill want to have some logical rules around this, and may want to follow some\\nform of RACI/DACI by team (or make this configurable by organization). This role\\nis purely for the team itself - for example a user may be responsible for writing /\\nediting the weekly reports for a team\\n8. Logically, when we are working with teams, we should treat parent teams as a superset\\nof all the sub-teams and projects they contain. A few examples:\\na. Adding a user to a child team will also add them to all parent teams as well, but in\\na minimalist role. Adding a member to the App Eng team will add that same\\nmember as a viewer to the Engineering team and a viewer to any other parent\\nteams above that.\\nb. Adding a user to a parent team will not add them to any child teams.\\nc. Removing a user from a parent team will remove them from all child teams as\\nwell.\\n9. Clicking on any Team node in the tree should show you reporting at that team level, both\\nstatus in terms of statistics and a list of weekly reports. Both should summarize all of the\\nsub-teams and projects within that team. Weekly reports will percolate up the tree.\\n\\nUpdate from 1/7:\\nI am running into a bit of a challenge, and wanted to write it up here to get a second opinion.\\n● Background: we now have a separate user object and organization_user object. The\\nlatter connects the user to an organization and contains org-specific info as well.\\n\\n\\x0c●\\n\\n●\\n\\n●\\n●\\n\\nProblem: it can be difficult to access the organization_user from the context of some\\nobjects. If you are working with a project, it is easy - you just look them up by\\norganizationId and userId. But for a sub-item like an issue, you only have projectId and\\nuserId. This is a problem both for reading data (think of the complications populating the\\nmy issues page for example), and when writing data.\\nPotential solutions:\\n○ Solution A - add a random ID to the organization_user table, and refer to that\\nfrom all of the other models. This makes it straightforward to connect to data but\\nchanges the foreign keys and input / outputs everywhere. It also gets verbose creatorOrganizationUserId for example (this is the solution I have mostly coded\\nup and working at this point). This also has a downside when you are creating\\nnew objects - you will have a user_id from the authenticated user but will need to\\nlook up the organization_user and may need to look up the organizationId to do\\nso.\\n○ Solution B - don’t have an id in the organization_user table, and do the\\nconnection based on both organization_id and user_id. In some cases, we will\\nneed to make another DB call to look up organization_id. Even worse, some of\\nthe data objects will have a user_id but will not be able to have a reference to the\\norganiztion_user table. For example, TemplateIssue will have a user_id but not\\nan organization_id field, and so cannot connect to that table directly. This will\\nmake for some nasty queries.\\n○ Solution C - similar to Solution B above, but denormalize organization_id, and set\\nit on pretty much all of our tables. This like Issues would have both a link to\\nproject_id and to organization_id, and from there could put together a link to\\norganization_user. There would still be a couple places we need to do an extra\\nlookup but only for write scenarios which should be ok. We would have some\\nduplicate data, but we should not be changing organization, and this could even\\nhelp us partition things a bit more cleanly.\\n○ Solution D - move to a single organization per user. The entire organization_user\\ntable would go away, and you would need to create a new user (with a new\\nemail) for each organization you wanted to be a part of.\\nProposal - after writing this down, I like solutions C and D. I think I will code up solution\\nC, and if that is too complex, move to option D.\\nConclusion - we will go with Solution D, and punt cross-org users into the future.\\n\\n\\x0c', 'this is the database schema definition of Willy in the format of prisma file. ```generator client {\\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\\n}\\n\\ndatasource db {\\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\\n}\\n\\nmodel User {\\n  id                       String               @id\\n  organizationId           String               @map(\"organization_id\")\\n  email                    String               @unique\\n  firstname                String\\n  lastname                 String\\n  username                 String\\n  department               Department?\\n  role                     UserRole             @default(EMPLOYEE)\\n  specialty                String?\\n  velocity                 Int?\\n  status                   RecordStatus         @default(ACTIVE)\\n  meta                     Json                 @default(\"{}\")\\n  createdAt                DateTime             @default(now()) @map(\"created_at\")\\n  updatedAt                DateTime             @updatedAt @map(\"updated_at\")\\n  Comment                  Comment[]\\n  createdDocuments         Document[]\\n  IssueChangeHistory       IssueChangeHistory[]\\n  createdIssues            Issue[]              @relation(\"createdBy\")\\n  ownedIssues              Issue[]              @relation(\"ownedBy\")\\n  createdProjects          Project[]            @relation(\"createdProjects\")\\n  ownedProjects            Project[]            @relation(\"ownedProjects\")\\n  createdTemplateDocuments TemplateDocument[]\\n  createdTemplateIssues    TemplateIssue[]\\n  createdTemplateProjects  TemplateProject[]\\n  teams                    UserTeam[]\\n  organization             Organization         @relation(fields: [organizationId], references: [id])\\n  createdWorkPlans         WorkPlan[]           @relation(\"createdWorkPlans\")\\n  ownedWorkPlans           WorkPlan[]           @relation(\"ownedWorkPlans\")\\n\\n  @@map(\"users\")\\n}\\n\\nmodel Organization {\\n  id                String             @id @default(cuid())\\n  name              String\\n  description       String?\\n  website           String?\\n  status            RecordStatus       @default(ACTIVE)\\n  createdAt         DateTime           @default(now()) @map(\"created_at\")\\n  updatedAt         DateTime           @updatedAt @map(\"updated_at\")\\n  projects          Project[]\\n  teams             Team[]\\n  templateDocuments TemplateDocument[]\\n  templateProjects  TemplateProject[]\\n  users             User[]\\n\\n  @@map(\"organizations\")\\n}\\n\\nmodel Team {\\n  id             String       @id @default(cuid())\\n  organizationId String       @map(\"organization_id\")\\n  parentTeamId   String?

      "What is needed to build a enterprise grade user management system for Omniflow?\n",
      "To build an enterprise-grade user management system for Omniflow, you will need to consider the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. User Authentication: Implement support for Google OAuth signup and login to allow users to quickly create accounts and access them without remembering additional passwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Team Management: Develop a mechanism for users to join teams through invitation links sent via email. Provide team admins with the capability to add and remove team members from the team management interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. User Account Management: Enable company admins to suspend or deactivate user accounts from the admin dashboard, allowing them to temporarily or permanently restrict access for certain users.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. High Availability and Scalability: Ensure the system has high availability with 99.9% uptime and can handle up to 10,000 concurrent users. This may involve implementing load balancing, redundancy, and scalability measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Data Security and Compliance: Ensure the system complies with GDPR regulations and provides data security measures to protect user information.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. User-Friendly Interface and Performance: Design a user-friendly interface with a response time of less than 2 seconds for all major actions to provide a smooth user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement these features, you will need a development team with expertise in web development, authentication protocols, database management, and security practices. Additionally, you may need to integrate with external services like Google OAuth for authentication.\n"
