Here’s a breakdown of the best fertility monitors, according to a healthcare professional.Share on PinterestA quick look at the best fertility monitorsBest overall: Mira Starter Kit |Skip to reviewRunner-up: Clearblue Fertility Monitor |Skip to reviewBest intravaginal fertility monitor: OvuSense Advanced Fertility Monitor |Skip to reviewRunner-up cervical fluid fertility monitor: kegg Fertility Tracker and Kegel Ball |Skip to reviewBest thermometer fertility monitor: Femometer Vinca 2.0 Digital Basal Thermometer |Skip to reviewRunner-up thermometer: Tempdrop Monitor |Skip to reviewBest budget fertility monitor: Easy@Home Ovulation Test Kit |Skip to reviewIf you’re a generally healthy person under the age of 35 and simply want to know when you’re ovulating so you can time intercourse, a simple at-home urine test should do the trick. These test strips are inexpensive and easy to use, much like an at-home pregnancy test.If you have a history of irregular periods, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid concerns, are over the age of 35, have been trying to get pregnant longer than a year, or are experiencing uncertainty about how to get pregnant or what’s going on with your body, you may wish to try a fertility monitor. Some people may find that monitoring data while trying to get pregnant increases stress levels, but some studies indicate that women using ovulation monitoring didn’t feel any increased stress and actually felt empowered and more able to achieve their pregnancy goals.Many monitors have apps that will track and interpret your data, and may be used in conjunction with seeing your OBGYN or a fertility specialist. It’s worth noting that these monitors are more expensive, more involved to use, and don’t guarantee a certain outcome. If you have concerns about your fertility, it’s still worth having a conversation with a healthcare professional.Do fertility monitors work?Yes, but not all methods are equal. This 2017 review of research concluded that measuring urinary levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen (E-1-3-G), and progesterone (PdG) have the highest accuracy when predicting when ovulation will occur, as well as confirming that ovulation has occurred. Assessing cervical mucous is moderately effective, while tracking basal body temperature (BBT) is considered the least effective method of fertility tracking. This is because BBT is affected by many factors, such as sleep, alcohol intake, room temperature, illness, fever, and medications.There’s some debate within the medical community about the exact implications and accuracy of BBT tracking. With app-based technology it’s possible to get some useful information from a BBT tracker, but it’s considered less effective than urinary hormone testing.We included some BBT fertility monitor options in case that’s your preferred method of tracking, or your healthcare professional recommends it. However, the gold standard for at-home ovulation testing is a simple test strip to check for urinary LH. Several of the options we feature, including our top pick, are urine tests that also include urinary progesterone (not just LH) and data tracking and interpretation.How we chose We used the following criteria to select the best fertility monitors:FDA registration: Many of these products have approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Tempdrop is the only product on our list that hasn’t been evaluated by the FDA.Online reviews: Our picks have mostly positive customer feedback that relates to effectiveness, accuracy, and ease of use. Published research: While more high quality research is needed in the area of at-home fertility monitors, we scoured the available scientific data to determine whether these monitoring methods are effective for helping people achieve pregnancy and learn about their menstrual cycles.Pricing guide$ = under $100 $$ = $100–$200$$$ = over $200Healthline’s picks of the best fertility monitorsBest fertility monitor overallMira Starter KitPrice: $$Type: digital urine testMira measures urinary progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and estrogen-estradiol metabolite with 99% accuracy. Mira connects to an app that tracks your results.To test, you collect a urine sample and insert the test wand into the monitor. You’ll need a separate wand to test for progesterone.While more research is needed, some research indicates that urine testing for both luteinizing hormone (which indicates ovulation will soon occur) and progesterone (which indicates ovulation has occurred) may increase effectiveness of cycle tracking, particularly for women who have irregular cycles or underlying health conditions that may cause them to ovulate infrequently.Because of this, Mira may help people with irregular cycles or PCOS to understand their cycles better. Mira is also useful for people who want to track hormones for mood, sleep, and hormonal acne.The Inito fertility monitor is another comparable option with the same smart features that costs about $50 less, but it’s only compatible with iPhones. For that reason, we made Mira our top pick.Prosprovides clear, accurate results easy-to-use app and device tests for progesterone (PdG), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen-estradiol metabolite (E3G)Consrecurring cost of testing wands some reports of bugs with the appresults take 15 minutes Was this helpful?Shop now at AmazonRunner-up fertility monitorClearblue Fertility MonitorPrice: $$Type: digital urine testThe Clearblue Fertility Monitor measures urinary estrogen and luteinizing hormone (LH) with 99% accuracy. The monitor indicates your two peak fertility days and high fertility days before ovulation, but it won’t chart your hormone levels or provide as much additional tracking data as the Mira.A 2020 study conducted by scientists at the development company that makes Clearblue products found that using this test kit to time intercourse during the fertile window increased the likelihood of pregnancy within two monthly cycles.An older 2007 study also found that women who used the Clearblue Fertility Monitor were 1.89 times more likely to get pregnant within two cycles than women who didn’t use this monitor. From 80% to 90% of participants said the monitor is convenient and easy to use.It lets you know which days you need to test, which involves inserting a urine test wand into the monitor. The urine test strips must be purchased separately. You must use this test within the same 6-hour window each day. This monitor features a user-friendly touchscreen that can store up to six cycles of personalized information. You can share this data with your doctor and use it to compare cycles.Prosaccurate and effective easy to use device also tests for pregnancy Consneed to purchase test sticks separately must start by day 4 of your cycle not ideal for long or irregular cycles Was this helpful?Shop now at AmazonBest intravaginal fertility monitorOvuSense Advanced Fertility MonitorPrice: $$$Type: wearable (intravaginal)This monitor provides you with an 8-day fertile period and notifies you 24 hours before you ovulate.It tracks your cycle and measures progesterone levels to confirm ovulation. Progesterone rises sharply after you ovulate, so it’s considered one of the more reliable methods to determine that ovulation has actually occurred. This may be helpful for people with irregular menstrual cycles (as people with regular cycles may have more success with the traditional LH urine sticks that tell you when you’re about to ovulate, rather than when ovulation has already occurred).To use the OvuCore monitor, you insert it in your vagina overnight. It measures your body temperature every 5 minutes and sends the data to the app. You’ll receive a notification once you ovulate.Prossuitable for people with irregular cycles and PCOS ideal for people with irregular sleep schedules confirms ovulation Conscan be difficult to interpret readingsconnectivity issues issues with customer service as reported by some usersrelatively expensivesome users reported discomfort wearing an intravaginal device every nightWas this helpful?Shop now at AmazonRunner-up cervical fluid fertility monitorkegg Fertility Tracker and Kegel BallPrice: $$$ Type: wearable (intravaginal)The kegg fertility tracker monitors the changing electrolyte levels of your cervical fluid. This helps to determine your fertile window and peak fertility so you can correctly time intercourse. While not as accurate as measuring hormone levels, it’s more accurate than tracking basal body temperature.In a 2013 study of more than 300 women, researchers concluded that while cervical mucus monitoring isn’t a common method of fertility tracking, participants who consistently tracked their cervical fluid were significantly more likely to get pregnant (even if they weren’t using other methods to track ovulation) than those who didn’t monitor their cervical fluid.The device doubles as a Kegel ball so you can strengthen your pelvic floor muscles before you take your daily reading, which only takes a few minutes. You’ll need to do your reading within the same 2-hour window each day. The kegg tracker connects to a free fertility app that displays your daily results, menstrual cycle data, and fertility status and predictions. According to the company, kegg is best for people who have regular cycles. kegg provides online chat support and gives you the option to join a supportive private Facebook group.Prosno recurring costs easy-to-use app and device works as a Kegel exerciser Consmust do daily reading within a 2-hour time frame app could provide more data, details, and interpretation not ideal for irregular cycles Was this helpful?Shop now at OptumBest thermometer fertility monitorFemometer Vinca 2.0 Digital Basal ThermometerPrice: $Type: thermometerThe Vinca 2.0 is a smart basal body temperature (BBT) thermometer that measures your morning temperature. You stick it under your tongue just like a regular oral thermometer, but BBT thermometers read to a more accurate degree than ordinary thermometers. This allows them to catch the small increases in temperature that indicate hormonal changes in your cycle. It’s worth noting that basal body temperature isn’t considered the most accurate way to track your cycle, although it has been used for many decades.The device then displays your results on the small LCD screen and transfers the information to the Femometer app via Bluetooth. The app also tracks your menstrual cycle and hormone indicators. We also evaluated the higher-tech Daysy smart BBT thermometer, but it sits at such a high price point. For the cost, most people would be better served by investing in one of the more accurate urine testing monitors, such as the Mira, ClearBlue, or Inito. Additionally, a 2018 study on the product’s efficacy was retracted over flawed methodology, so there are concerns around how well it works and whether it could lead to unplanned pregnancies.Proseasy to use provides clear, accurate readings Consapp costs $10 per month app needs improvementWas this helpful?Shop now at AmazonRunner-up thermometerTempdrop MonitorPrice: $$$Type: wearable (armband)Typically monitoring BBT requires taking your temperature with a BBT thermometer immediately upon waking from a full night of sleep. Instead, Tempdrop is an armband device that measures your basal body temperature. Some find it more comfortable and user-friendly than other armband monitors. You wear it while you sleep so you don’t have to worry about waking up at the same time each day, so it’s great for people who have an irregular schedule. You can sync the information to the Tempdrop app, which includes options to chart other signs of fertility so you can learn more about the phases of your cycle. You can also use the app to connect to the support team and community. Worth noting: The Femometer will give you the same temperature information for less than half the price, but if you want something a little more comprehensive with a more user-friendly app and are willing to spend the money, this could be for you.Also consider that for just around $20 more than the cost of Tempdrop (plus the ongoing price of additional wands), you could purchase the Mira for a more accurate option than both Tempdrop and Femometer.

This box contains 25 ovulation test strips, as well as 10 pregnancy test strips (which makes it an absolute steal, since pregnancy tests can be expensive all by themselves).The strips aren’t fancy, but the instructions are clear and you can get results within minutes. Depending on how regular your cycles are and your pregnancy goals, you can choose to test every day, every other day, or every few days during your cycle. The test strips are measuring for the surge in LH that happens in the 2 days prior to ovulation.Proseasy to useaffordableis a urine test, which is considered the most effective at-home method for identifying fertile windowConsdoesn’t provide any additional informationtest strips are small and may be easily droppedWas this helpful?Shop now at AmazonComparing fertility monitorsFertility monitorPrice Type of device Mira Fertility Tracker$$touchscreen urine monitorClearblue Fertility Monitor$$touchscreen urine monitorOvuSense Advanced Fertility Monitor$$$ vaginal thermometer kegg Fertility Tracker and Kegel Ball$$$vaginal device and Kegel ballFemometer Vinca 2.0 Digital Basal Thermometer$basal body temp thermometerTempdrop Monitor$$$ armband BBT thermometer Easy@Home Ovulation Kit$urine strip ovulation tracker As you shop for a fertility monitorTo select the best fertility monitor, there are several factors to consider:Decide if you want to test your temperature, hormone levels, or vaginal fluid. From here, you can decide which type of device you want to use. Consider your lifestyle and schedule if the test requires you to test at a specific time or window of time. Some monitors require daily tests while others prompt you to test on certain days of the month.Factor in the cost of the device and testing strips, which can add up over time. You can also decide how detailed you prefer your data to be and if you want to use an app. If you have irregular cycles or any health condition, select a suitable device for your needs. When to see a doctorIf you are under the age of 35 and have been trying to conceive for a year or longer, make an appointment to see a fertility doctor. If you’re over the age of 35, make an appointment after 6 months of trying to conceive without success. If you’re over the age of 40, see a fertility doctor after 3 months of trying to conceive or as soon as possible. A fertility doctor can perform a thorough evaluation that involves hormonal tests, blood work, physical exam, and an ultrasound. Understanding your body and risk factors is helpful, and your doctor may suggest interventions or treatments to best address your needs.Frequently asked questionsWhat is the best fertility monitor for PCOS?We think the Mira fertility tracker is the best for those with PCOS or irregular cycles because it measures progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and estrogen, which is considered to be the most accurate way to detect ovulation.How much do fertility monitors cost?Basic fertility monitors, such as thermometers, may cost around $50 while many devices cost several hundred dollars. Some monitors require you to purchase additional testing strips, which can cost up to $100 every few weeks. Are fertility monitors covered by insurance?You may be able to use your insurance plan, flexible spending account (FSA), or health savings account (HSA) to cover the cost of fertility monitors. The bottom lineFertility monitors can help you to track your menstrual cycle to predict ovulation and fertility. This information can help you determine the best time for intercourse if you want to conceive. Most devices are easy to use and provide valuable insights into your menstrual cycle and fertile periods. In most cases, we recommend using a basic ovulation urine test strip because they’re both accurate and cost effective, but if you’re wanting more information or experiencing difficulty conceiving, you might want to invest in something more comprehensive. It’s worth talking with your doctor if you’re concerned about your fertility.However, remember that fertility monitors are not 100% accurate or foolproof, nor do they guarantee conception. Furthermore, they aren’t intended to prevent pregnancy.

Nov 5, 2021    By kegg Team                   From a glance:      Mira tracks urine metabolites to predict ovulation The Mira user is required to use multiple ‘plus wands’ per cycle (dependent on cycle length) 1-2 times per day kegg tracks the changes in cervical fluid to predict and show the full fertile window. kegg is used one time a day for 2 minutes The kegg user can see their fertile window open and progress in real-time to ensure they are optimally timing their TTC efforts. kegg is a one time investment: there are no recurring costs, wands, or subscription fees Average monthly cost of Mira wands per 28 day cycle is $93.25 (analyzer not included-$199) Total cost when trying to get pregnant for 6 months Mira – ~$550  kegg – $259       When I began using Mira, I was eager to see if my awareness of my fertile window would be sooner, later, or at the same time as with my kegg. I am a long-time fertility awareness method charter and kegg user so my cycle awareness is strong. I like to test out products that are popular so I can lend some perspective to others that are curious. With my passion for women’s health and fertility, I get asked all the time “What is the best fertility bracelet?” or “What is the most reliable fertility tracker?”  My interest was peaked to see if Mira could yield any additional insights that I had been missing out on.      Mira: Urine metabolite tracker      Mira is a fertility tracking system that uses urine metabolites to monitor the user’s fertility status.  It includes a small handheld analyzer, access to the Mira app, and requires single-use urine test sticks.   The Mira fertility sticks or “plus wands” are used for tracking the urine metabolites of Estradiol and Luteinizing Hormone to predict when the user is likely fertile or not.   Confirm wands are also used to track progesterone metabolites.      How Mira works    The Mira Fertility Tracker has an app which provides fertility insights. The “Mira Analyzer” itself indicates the numeric results of the most recent urine metabolite test and sends the results via bluetooth to your phone. The app uses an algorithm that determines when you will need to test and how many times a day, but typically the user starts with testing once a day and then increases to two times per day around predicted ovulation. To test, the user collects first morning urine and dips the wand for 10-12 seconds, then inserts the wand into the analyzer. It takes the analyzer 16 minutes to read and display the test result. Results are displayed both with a numeric value for LH and Estrogen, as well as a 1-10 Fertility Score, with 10 indicating that it is likely your ovulation day. For women that have a difficult time catching the LH surge or have multiple surges in a cycle, Mira may take up quite a bit of time and budget.       kegg: Cervical Mucus tracker      kegg is a small, sleek fertility tracker which senses cervical fluid (and its electrolyte levels) to predict the full fertile window.   In 2-minutes a day, the user gains insight into her cycle, by watching the trend of the daily readings, and seeing the predicted fertility status, all displayed in the kegg app.   As the user enters the fertile window, the kegg readings will descend on the y-axis due to the increasingly more hospitable vaginal environment and rising estrogen.  The kegg user inputs their periods, and has the option to enter other information, such as cervical mucus observations, temperature, LH, PdG, and hCG tests. These optional items do not influence the algorithm.      How kegg works:    kegg detects the changes in the cervical fluid, objectively displaying the daily readings on the kegg chart so the user can see their data unfold in real-time. The kegg algorithm is sophisticated and learns about my unique cycle and uses this data to formulate it’s predictions. kegg is used on all non-bleeding days one time per day. The user can choose a convenient time for use (typically morning or evening) with a flexible 2 hour time frame each day. The kegg device is placed vaginally for the reading and can also be used to complete guided kegel exercises before taking the fertility reading. The app is free to use and kegg does not require any recurring costs of sticks or wands.      My experience with Mira    The Mira Fertility Tracker has an appealing, sophisticated look. However, I very quickly learned I would not want to use Mira for long term cycle tracking as it is cost prohibitive, and creates a lot of waste.         I also did not find that my Mira results were insightful when it comes to knowing my most fertile days. For example, even though I could see my estrogen rising, I did not know when my LH would surge relative to this, making the fertile window prediction feel like a guess at best. With kegg, I am very familiar with my “drop” in kegg readings that typically lasts 4 to 5 days. When I see my descending values, I can confidently assume I am in my fertile window. Of course, the added fertile window prediction provided by kegg gives me added confidence of my timing. The displays While both kegg and Mira provide graphs of results, I found the kegg app colors and trend line easier on my eyes. The y-axis on the Mira graphs is hard to read and the results are plotted with a thin line. Especially when tracking multiple hormones, these thin, light lines are difficult to discern. kegg on the other hand uses the readings in small circles with a dark, very evident trendline that is easy to spot.         Both Mira’s and kegg’s algorithms need to learn about your cycles. Since Mira uses single-use test wands, I felt like the app should have communicated more precisely when I needed to use the Plus wands a second time in a day. Mira fertility wands are quite expensive each cycle and can’t be bought in box stores so I didn’t want to use more than needed. Users with cycles longer than 28 days or irregular cycles will often need more than the 10-15 Plus wands in a cycle. My assumption was progesterone wands would be optional and used after an LH surge was detected, as testing for the progesterone metabolites before or during your fertile window will not aid in the prediction of ovulation tracking. This is not the case.  Ever since Mira updated their app in September, 2021 the Confirm wands have been pushed every cycle day.  Upon first opening the app I was asked to test with a Confirm Wand or instructed to purchase them. While the use of the Confirm Wands is still optional (at this time), many users will likely assume they’re missing out on necessary data and feel they are not doing all that they can to accurately track their fertility.        Testing with 15 Plus wands and 15 Confirm wands each cycle seems excessive and I expected to only need a few of both types of wands after a couple of cycles but this was not my experience.  Supposedly after some period of time, the count decreases as the algorithm learns your cycle but it can take 4-6 cycles for this to happen and that’s if your cycles are regular.  Mira’s website recommends 10-15 plus wands per cycle.   I stopped using Mira after 2 cycles because the cost was exuberant and the insights weren’t anything new. Unfortunately, the cost of the analyzer is expensive so I feel the investment was not worthwhile.           The benefits of Mira     Mira has a TTA (trying to avoid or postpone pregnancy) profile setting that so far looks and acts the same as the TTC setting. Mira promotes itself as a useful tool to be used alongside NFP (Natural Family Planning). I have read through Mira’s TTA information and it seems mucus tracking and/or temperature tracking is still needed. Mira warns on their website that “no fertility tracker is approved by the FDA as a 100% sure-proof contraceptive.” When you consider the cost, especially over years of use, I would not want to use or recommend Mira for avoiding or postponing pregnancy, especially for a long period of time. When considering it would cost, at minimum $901 a year (at the time of this writing), and still require additional tracking means, I was astonished. kegg is not recommended as a contraceptive device but it can be used as a complementary tool to your preferred fertility awareness-based method (FABM), without any recurring costs.I did find it intriguing and motivating that Mira displays numeric values for the metabolite levels it detects in urine. I think this could yield interesting cycle comparison data. I do feel, however, that urine concentration plays a significant role in the accuracy of the results. From years of tracking various forms of fertility data, I have learned that I do not capture a surge in LH with first morning urine, and instead see the surge later in the day. In fact, many women will not be able to detect an LH surge until later on, usually between 10 AM to 2 PM so I question why Mira recommends first morning urine and how many users might “miss” this surge when following their instructions for testing. My best guess is that consistent hydration/concentration of urine is needed for accurate results. This is something to keep in mind if you drink water overnight or need to use the bathroom in the early morning hours.Mira states that it can be used for women with PCOS and irregular cycles. According to their website, users with irregular cycles may need to test more frequently to “find your ovulation”. This is concerning to me, as I already felt there was a substantial cost associated with a “typical” 28-day cycle, so for users with lengthy cycles, the cost could be astronomical. Comparatively, many women with PCOS are successful with kegg and are able to watch their trendline to identify the fertile valley(s). kegg provides fertile window predictions for users with cycles 21-40 days in length, but all users can see their daily readings and watch the overall trend to confidently time their efforts during the valleys.     My Concluding Thoughts    It’s always encouraging to see new and different fertility tracking tools available to women and couples trying to conceive or simply learn more about their fertility.  Mira has gained a good deal of popularity but as I’ve read in other Mira fertility reviews, my experience is quite similar to many other women.  So Is Mira worth the money? For me, the recurring cost of Mira wands isn’t worth the numeric data the app provides. On the other hand, kegg is a one time investment with zero recurring costs and offers fascinating data and insights to my fertility and full fertile window.

However, not all Marquette Method Instructors have received training on utilizing the Mira monitor. All of the instructors listed in the Mira class schedules are experienced with Mira.What is the difference between the Clearblue Fertility Monitor and the Mira monitor?The Clearblue Fertility Monitor tracks estrogen and luteinizing hormone (LH) to provide three levels of fertility: low, high, or peak based on threshold levels of fertility hormones while the Mira monitor measures quantitative amounts of these hormones and provides a number value per measurement. The Mira monitor can measure estrogen, LH, progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and soon human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).Which Mira wands (test strips) should I use?Due to the  ability to personalize testing and the more detailed approach of the Mira monitor, you will meet with your instructor to discuss your situation and which wands would be best for you.How much does the Mira monitor cost compared to the Clearblue Fertility Monitor?The Clearblue Fertility Monitor is approximately $120 new and $50-$100 used. The Mira monitor is $160-180 new and $50-$150 used. Be aware that Mira does not recommend using a “used” monitor. At this time, it is recommended to use the Mira monitor in conjunction with the current Marquette Method instructions, which should be considered when evaluating the cost.How much does the Mira monitor wands cost compared to the Clearblue Fertility Monitor test strips?Mira wands prices vary from $3.25-$4.45/each depending on the specific type of wands. Clearblue fertility test strips cost approximately $1.50/each. In general, testing with the Mira monitor will cost two to three times more than testing with the Clearblue Fertility Monitor. Please contact us after you register for a class if you would like a coupon code for the Mira test wands.Which monitor will be better for me, the Mira or the Clearblue Fertility Monitor?Tracking your hormones using the Clearblue Fertility Monitor is an evidence-based published method for fertility tracking established by researchers at the Marquette University Institute of Natural Family Planning (MU-INFP). The information obtained from the Mira monitor is promising but has not been extensively researched compared to the Clearblue Fertility Monitor, and we are aware of ethical dilemmas associated withe the Mira company that need to be weighed before choosing the Mira monitor.* There are studies currently being completed using the Mira monitor with hopes to publish official protocols in the future. Women who may benefit from obtaining quantitative (number) hormone measurements with the Mira monitor are women with PCOS, irregular cycles, those in perimenopause and postpartum women. The Mira can also be used to help women in complex medical situations, such as women on chemotherapy, those with a history of high risk pregnancies, and women whose medical provider has recommended their use of the Mira monitor.  At this time we recommend consulting with a Marquette Method instructor before purchasing the Mira monitor. Contact us here.I noticed the Mira specific classes through Whole Mission are more expensive than the standard Marquette Method classes, why is that?The data obtained from Mira is more in-depth and specific to each person, requiring additional time for the instructor to review. Additionally, those using Mira are often in unique and complicated situations that require additional support and follow-up with the instructor. Mira Classes*A Note on Mira:We are aware that Mira as a company has shown support for practices and behaviors that are contrary to Catholic teaching. We strongly disagree with those views, and only recommend the use of the Mira monitor for use in Natural Family Planning, while preserving the natural fertility of the man and woman. We are opposed to ART/IVF and any behaviors and actions that do not respect the inherent dignity of persons and honor the unitive and procreative nature of intercourse, and further reject those behaviors and actions that do not honor the gift of marriage between one man and one woman.

And 26% of married women in the same age range suffer from impaired fecundity (difficulty carrying a pregnancy to term).1 The effects of infertility aren’t only physical, but psychological and emotional. One study of 200 heterosexual couples experiencing infertility found that half of the women and 15% of the men felt that infertility was “the most upsetting experience of their lives.”2 Minorities also tend to face unique fertility struggles. Women of color, for example, are more likely to be blamed for their infertility or have their concerns dismissed.3 And lesbian and bisexual women have overall poorer pregnancy success rates than heterosexual women.4 Additionally, while fertility statistics aren’t as readily available for transgender or gender non-conforming people, gender-affirming surgery or medical treatment may negatively impact fertility.5 6 With fertility concerns being a widespread issue affecting many different groups, companies like Mira aim to make fertility tracking more accessible to everyone who wants or needs it. Since typical infertility testing and treatments can be costly, invasive, and time-consuming, the option of at-home non-invasive hormone tracking at a lesser cost can be an excellent alternative. But is Mira the ideal choice for you? For this review, we conducted hands-on testing of Mira’s products and examined the science behind fertility tracking and reproductive health to see if the company’s claims hold up. Our FindingsEditor's Rating4.30 Mira’s fertility tracker is a convenient, effective, and easy-to-use device for better understanding your cycle, ovulation, fertility, and hormone levels. And the additional fertility health products have generally positive scientific backing. However, while Mira is initially cost-effective, purchasing additional testing wands can add up over time. ProsMore budget-friendly than traditional lab-based fertility trackingEasy-to-use testing kit and mobile app with clear and understandable resultsExpanded testing options that monitor four fertility hormones (LH, FSH, E3G, PdG)Offers additional products like fertility-friendly lubricant, vitamins, and moreSupplementary resources include a blog, online course, webinars, and ebooksGet 10% off when you sign up for the newsletterTake $20 off your Mira Starter KitConsSingle-use testing wands require repeated ordering, which can add up fastWhile it can help those with hormone imbalances or irregular cycles, Mira is marketed more toward people who are trying to conceiveApp does not provide information about typical healthy hormone rangesReturn and money-back policies pale in comparison to some competitorsPurchase optionsWe recommend buying directly from Mira. There is an official Mira Amazon store, but the products mainly appear to be sold by third parties — the tracker, wands, and even the teas. For something as sensitive as a fertility tracker, we’d prefer to see Mira as the seller. Additionally, the Mira website offers more products than the Amazon store, such as personal lubricant, prenatal vitamins, and coaching sessions. Using our links on this page will also take $20 off your purchas of a Basic Mira Starter Kit.Buy on MiraBuy on Amazon Table of ContentsIn this Review Why you should trust us Over the past two decades, Innerbody Research has helped tens of millions of readers like you make more informed decisions to live healthier lives. We conduct thorough research and hands-on testing of each health service and product we review. Fertility health is a highly personal topic, and every family-building journey is unique. In order to provide you with the information you need to decide if Mira is the fertility tracker for you, our team has spent over 150 hours testing and researching Mira, its close competitors, fertility testing, and reproductive health in general. Whenever we evaluate products or services, we also examine their adherence to quality, the latest medical evidence, and current health and safety standards. Additionally, like all health-related content on this website, our review of Mira was thoroughly vetted for accuracy by one or more members of our Medical Review Board. How we evaluated Mira Mira is a quickly expanding company, introducing new products to meet its customers’ needs — from fertility tracking and prenatal vitamins to tea and vaginal lubricant. We chose our evaluation criteria to provide you with a comprehensive view of the company. Specifically, we considered Mira’s efficacy, customer experience, cost, and privacy. Efficacy Rating: 9.3 / 10 When it comes to at-home fertility products, Mira sets a pretty high standard. According to a clinical trial evaluating the Mira fertility tracker, it effectively determines fertile and nonfertile days and the onset of ovulation.7 Some competitors also show similar efficacy to Mira. In particular, Clearblue’s fertility monitor was compared to Mira in the aforementioned clinical trial, and the two were considered equivalent in effectiveness and patient satisfaction.7 Mira doesn’t just offer a fertility tracker; the company also sells various other products aimed at supporting fertility health. These include a male fertility test, prenatal vitamins, menstrual cups, a fertility-friendly lubricant, teas, and more. Many of these products have a decent amount of positive evidence suggesting that they can aid people who are trying to conceive (TTC) in one way or another. We delve further into that research later on in this review. And even if you aren’t TTC, Mira’s monitoring can help those with hormone concerns, like PCOS or endometriosis, individuals looking to avoid pregnancy, and pretty much anyone with ovaries who may benefit from (or simply want to) monitor their cycles with more precise information than that offered by simple calendar-based period trackers. The company also contributes to ongoing research to better understand fertility and improve its products to meet customers’ diverse needs. Customer experience Rating: 9.2 / 10 Two of the major perks of Mira versus traditional fertility testing is that it ships right to your door and you don’t have to send your sample away for testing. Collecting your sample (in the provided silicone collection cup) is as easy as taking an at-home pregnancy test. The Mira Analyzer is intuitive, and the instructions provided in your test kit and on Mira’s website are clear and comprehensive. You also don’t have to wait days or weeks to get your results. On average, the device takes between 10-16 minutes to provide your reading. And, once your test is complete, the analyzer sends the results directly to the Mira mobile app via Bluetooth. The Mira app itself is also user-friendly, providing all of your testing information at your fingertips. The calendar tracks your period, ovulation, and testing days, while the chart shows all of your test results and provides you with your fertile window. You can also buy products and read news and blog posts from the app. While the interface is simple, it provides you with everything you want to know about your results and your fertility in one place. If you’re not a fan of having to connect your phone with your fertility monitor, then an all-in-one option like Clearblue’s touchscreen fertility monitor might be an ideal alternative for you. However, even though the Mira app stores your information, it doesn’t interpret it. For example, when you receive your first results, you may wonder if your hormone levels are in a normal range or if you should be concerned, which is a perfectly natural thing to wonder when receiving this information. While the Mira Analyzer does not provide an answer, Mira’s customer support page includes more in-depth information about questions like this. The Mira Analyzer does clearly explain ovulation tracking details, though.  The Mira customer support page houses an extensive FAQ with articles on nearly every aspect of its products, including the app, analyzer, wands, and other offerings. This page also includes articles about shipping, returns, warranties, payment, and financing. The articles are searchable and provide thorough responses. This is similar to the depth and helpfulness of the FAQs from competitors OvuSense and Modern Fertility. If you don’t find the answer to your question on the FAQ page, you can email customer support or start a chat. Typically, you should expect a response within 48 hours. One of our testers received a response in less than 24 hours with a clear and understandable answer. Cost Rating: 8.1 / 10 With only 21 U.S. states having any kind of insurance coverage laws for fertility, the expense of fertility testing and monitoring can be cost-prohibitive for many people, not to mention time-consuming and invasive.8 Now, with home testing options like Mira allowing you to test from the privacy of your own home for a fraction of the cost, fertility testing and tracking have become much more accessible — especially since many of them (including Mira) are HSA/FSA eligible. Mira offers four different bundles that include the Mira Analyzer device and various different testing wands depending on the bundle. Later on, we examine these bundles in further detail, but here are the basic prices:  Mira Starter Kit: $199 Mira Max Starter Kit: $229-$249 Mira Clarity Bundle: $259 Mira Confirm Bundle: $249  Packs of replacement wands cost between $40 and $89.99, depending on the type and quantity of wand you choose. You can also subscribe to have the wands delivered to you monthly or bi-monthly for a savings of 10% or 5% off, respectively. Additionally, shipping on orders over $148 is free (otherwise it’s about $9).  It’s important to keep in mind that one of the benefits of Mira is the data you collect about your cycle and hormone levels. So, the more data you collect, the more accurate your results and the better your understanding of your hormone patterns will be. This may mean testing more often and consistently. The bundles come with some testing wands, which are single-use. If you decide to keep testing, you’ll need to purchase additional wands, which can definitely add up. If you prefer a one-and-done testing approach and don’t mind pricking your finger to give a blood sample, then Modern Fertility may be an ideal option for you. This alternative costs $179. Clearblue’s fertility monitor and sticks need to be purchased separately from the outset (unlike Mira, which includes some wands to start with) and it will run you about $120 for the monitor and $55+ (depending on the retailer) for a 30-pack of sticks. Privacy Rating: 8.5 / 10 In a post Roe v. Wade America, you’re not alone if you’re worried about period or fertility tracking apps sharing your data.51 Because of this, Mira is currently working on implementing an “Incognito Mode” feature into its app. This will allow you to use the app without any personally identifying information (like an email address), and all data about your device will be fully encrypted. Mira explains that this will leave the company with no way to identify the user or share data if requested by law enforcement. Otherwise, Mira collects personal and fertility-related information but has processes in place to keep your info safe (the company calls these processes “reasonable security precautions”). If you’re a resident of California, then you can opt out of the sale of your personal information in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, Mira notes that it does not “sell” your information in exchange for profit, but instead may disclose certain information to third parties who provide Mira with various services (like interest-based advertising). Either way, you can still opt out. On the research end of things, Mira may use your anonymized fertility information as a part of the company’s “mission to better understand fertility and help women make powerful and informed choices.” Mira may also share your personal info like age or test results (again, with identifying information removed) with other third-party researchers. This is similar to the privacy policy of one competitor, Ava, which may use non-identifying data in academic journals, medical conferences, or in other ways to further fertility and reproductive health research. What is Mira? Scientist Sylvia M. Kang created Mira to provide support to those facing stigma and a lack of information about their fertility concerns. The company’s goal is to help anyone with ovaries monitor and track their fertile and nonfertile days to help them conceive and better understand ovulation patterns. The Mira fertility tracker analyzes hormones present in urine samples that you take at home. After collecting a urine sample, you dip in one of Mira’s wands, insert the wand into the analyzer, and then wait a few minutes for your results. The Mira mobile app helps you store your personalized fertility information and track your data. If you’re having trouble getting pregnant, knowing this information can help you better understand your hormone patterns and the best time during your cycle to try to conceive. In addition to the fertility kit, Mira also has several other products that can help with fertility health and monitoring, such as vitamins and teas. Mira also offers an at-home sperm motility test, a fertility-friendly lubricant, and more through its partnerships with other providers. Mira also has plans to expand and offer:  Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) monitoring Early pregnancy tracking Stress hormone and endocrine system monitoring Hormone health courses Additional supplements and treatments Telemedicine services  Who is Mira for? Mira’s products can provide a better understanding of your personal hormone levels, fertile and nonfertile days, and menstrual cycle. If you are trying to conceive, this information can be invaluable, especially if you’re among the millions of Americans each year who struggle with infertility.1 And while the main target audience is those trying to become pregnant, Mira does state on its website that its tracker can be for any ovulating person who wants to learn from it — including those who are already pregnant, those in perimenopause, and people with PCOS, endometriosis, or other hormone concerns. We've found more affordable testing options for menopausal or postmenopausal people and would recommend they pursue those higher-value options instead (for instance, a test kit from Everlywell). Also, people with PCOS, endometriosis, and irregular cycles will likely benefit from more rigorous tracking than those with regular cycles. Additionally, for those trying to prevent pregnancy or those who just want to monitor their cycles, Mira offers more precise information than a simple period tracker. It's important to note, however, that Mira's fertility tracker isn't an FDA-approved contraceptive device. While Mira’s products can’t treat or solve infertility, the company aims to help you better understand your status, and it can provide you with information that can be shared with your doctor if necessary. Mira online reviews If you search for Mira reviews on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) website, you’ll likely find that there are two similar pages using the name “Mira” — Mira Health and Mira Care. The former appears to be a telehealth service, while the latter is the fertility-centered company this review is focused on. Mira is not accredited by the BBB and currently has a B- with a 1 out of 5 rating from eight total reviews. The majority of customer complaints are about Mira devices suddenly not working, with a few billing concerns as well. Mira’s reviews on Trustpilot aren’t much better; the company currently has 1.8 out of 5 stars from 14 total reviews. Of those reviews, 93% are 1-star, while only 7% are 5-star. The reasons for customer complaints are similar to those on the BBB website, but many Trustpilot reviews also claim Mira’s fertility wands expired quicker than they should have. On Amazon, however, the Mira Fertility Starter Kit boasts a 4.2 out of 5 rating from 805 reviews. While complaints of devices breaking or wands expiring early can still be found, many more customers report that the Mira device provided them with an easy-to-use method for accurately tracking hormone levels. Special Offer: $20 OFF the Mira Starter KitVisit Mira Does Mira work? Mira offers various products aimed at supporting people with ovaries on their journey to conceive. The main draw of Mira is its fertility tracker and wands, but the company also sells specialized teas, lubricant, a prenatal vitamin, and more. But can these products actually support your chances of getting pregnant? The chart below breaks down some of the research behind Mira’s various offerings. Fertility trackingResearch shows that while calendar-based fertility tracking apps are often inaccurate (averaging 19% accuracy), home ovulation trackers from market-leading brands are much more reliable (up to 99% accuracy).9In terms of the Mira tracker itself, we first need to take a look at the competition. In 2007, researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial that found the Clearblue Fertility Monitor to increase pregnancy rates.10 They also concluded that the device was a “significant factor affecting the chance of conceiving within two cycles.” In a 2021 clinical trial, the Mira fertility tracker was pitted against Clearblue. Researchers found Mira to work just as well as Clearblue, with no statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction.7 Male fertility testingResearch estimates the male or AMAB partner to be a primary or contributing factor in approximately 50% of infertility cases.11 So, assessing sperm count, sperm morphology, and motile sperm concentration (MSC) can be a vital step when trying to conceive. Mira sells a male fertility test from partner company, YO, that checks these factors. Ro (the company behind Modern Fertility) also offers the Ro Sperm Kit, which tests sperm viability and allows you to cryogenically store your samples (first year is free and additional years cost $149 each). Prenatal vitaminsAccording to the Mayo Clinic, it’s ideal to start taking prenatal vitamins at least three months before conception to ensure the baby’s neural tube (brain and spinal cord) develops properly. Additionally, a good prenatal vitamin should contain iron, folic acid, calcium, zinc, iodine, vitamins D, A, E, C, and various B vitamins.12 Mira’s prenatal vitamin contains almost all of those with the exception of iron. While iron is important to support the healthy development of the placenta and fetus,12 the inclusion of vitamin C may at least help you absorb more iron.13 And pregnant individuals, themselves, also benefit from iron, as about 10% or more of them become anemic.52Modern Fertility’s prenatal vitamin includes all of the aforementioned essential ingredients, plus iron, omega-3s, and biotin. And women-focused vitamin company, Ritual, also offers a complete prenatal vitamin (with citrus or mint flavors to help mask its included omega-3s). Basal body thermometerThe basal body temperature method is a type of natural family planning that aims to predict ovulation based on measuring your basal body temperature (your temperature when you’re fully at rest).14 While this method may work for some people, research generally paints it as unreliable, averaging about a 22% accuracy rate.15 Menstrual cupsMenstrual cups not only act as a more environmentally friendly alternative to pads and tampons, but research suggests they can also act as a fertility aid by holding sperm close to the cervix.16 Fertility meditationMeditation may not be the first thing that comes to mind when considering ways to boost your fertility, but some research suggests it may be beneficial. A 2016 study found that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) improved the pregnancy rates of those who underwent their first in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.17 And a separate 2020 study showed reductions in psychological distress and enhanced conception rates in infertile individuals after the use of MBIs.18 Fertility-friendly lubricantNot all vaginal lubricants are fertility-friendly; some can actually be detrimental to sperm function.19 Certain qualities — like like having a pH similar to that of the vagina and being free of glycerin — can help make a lubricant fertility-friendly.20 21 22 The lubricant sold by Mira, from partner company Good Clean Love, boasts both characteristics, as well as being paraben-free (parabens may have a negative impact on fertility).23 KegelsMira offers a device to help those trying to conceive train their pelvic floor muscles through Kegel exercises. While there’s no evidence showing that Kegels can help you get pregnant, they may make delivery easier and reduce postpartum incontinence.24 Since Mira’s fertility and pregnancy teas each have several ingredients with varying degrees of supporting evidence, we’ve created separate charts for them.

The aim of the Mira kit is to track your hormone patterns, help you pinpoint ovulation, and reveal your fertile window (the days in your cycle when you are most likely to conceive). This is done by measuring the various levels of hormones in your urine. The available Mira Wands test for one or more of four hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH), oestrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), pregnanediol-3a-glucuronide (PdG), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). But what do the levels of these hormones actually mean for fertility or ovulation? The chart below breaks this information down. Luteinizing hormone (LH)Luteinizing hormone is produced and released by the pituitary gland. In women and AFAB individuals, LH is the hormone that leads the ovaries to produce oestradiol (also sometimes spelled as “estradiol”). LH also causes the ovaries to release an egg during the ovulation period. If the egg becomes fertilized, LH works to ensure the pregnancy is sustained through the production of progesterone.40When LH levels are too high, this could indicate polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can make pregnancy difficult due to higher levels of androgens. On the other hand, if LH is too low, then ovulation may stop.40 Oestrone-3-glucuronide (E3G)Oestrone-3-glucuronide is a metabolite of oestradiol that can be detected in urine.41 Basically, E3G is produced as estrogen metabolizes in your body. According to the FDA, levels of this metabolite rise around ovulation, causing cervical mucus to thin. This may allow sperm to move more easily, which could potentially increase the chances of conception.42 Pregnanediol-3a-glucuronide (PdG)Like E3G, pregnanediol-3a-glucuronide is also a metabolite, but of progesterone instead of oestradiol.43 The levels of PdG can help determine if a menstrual cycle is anovulatory (without ovulation, lower PdG), or ovulatory (with ovulation, higher PdG).44 Measuring this hormone can help you confirm whether or not you’ve ovulated. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)Follicle-stimulating hormone is made by the pituitary gland and helps to regulate the menstrual cycle.45 FSH is the hormone that causes one of the follicles of the ovaries to form a mature egg. At around the middle of the menstrual cycle (approximately 14 days), luteinizing hormone increases and the egg is released (ovulation). At this point, progesterone prevents the release of FSH and levels drop.45 Some of Mira’s competitors, like Modern Fertility and Clearblue, also measure various hormones. But some options don’t, like Ava and OvuSense, and instead rely on things like your body temperature or heart rate. Mira starter kits and bundles The main attraction of Mira’s products is its fertility tracker, which you can purchase as one of the company’s four bundles. All Mira kits and bundles are eligible for HSA/FSA or pay-in-four installment financing through Shop Pay, and they ship for free. Prices are as follows:  Mira Starter Kit: $199 Mira Max Starter Kit: $229-$249 Mira Clarity Bundle: $259 Mira Confirm Bundle: $249  While each kit and bundle comes with the Mira Analyzer device, the main difference is the included wands. These wands measure different hormones — luteinizing hormone (LH), oestrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), pregnanediol-3a-glucuronide (PdG), or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones play different roles in fertility, as discussed in more detail in the above section. The following list shows which wands each bundle or kit comes with and the quantities.  Starter Kit: A 10-pack of Fertility Plus Wands (E3G and LH) Max Starter Kit: Either a 10- or 20-pack of Max Wands (LH, E3G, and PdG) Clarity Bundle: A 10-pack of Max Wands (LH, E3G, and PdG) and a 10-pack of Ovum Wands (FSH) Confirm Bundle: A 10-pack of Fertility Plus Wands (E3G and LH) and a 10-pack of Confirm Wands (PdG)  Something we appreciate about Mira is that all of the bundles and kits come with some wands to start with. Clearblue, for instance, requires that you buy its tracker and wands separately from the get-go, making the initial cost higher than Mira’s. All of Mira’s kits and bundles also come with a user guide, charging cord, silicone cup, and carrying pouch. When you receive your bundle or kit, you’ll have to download the Mira app, which is free and compatible with all iOS and Android devices. The app connects to the analyzer via Bluetooth and keeps track of your testing data.  Which Mira bundle is for me? While anyone with ovaries can use any kit or bundle they’d prefer to help keep track of their hormones and fertility windows, Mira does list some information on the product pages that may help you figure out which one is best for you. Mira Starter KitThis kit provides the basics of the Mira experience. It’s for those “looking for fertile clarity” who are interested in tracking their hormone patterns and getting predictions for their ovulation and 6-day fertile window (which are also functions of all the other kits and bundles). Mira Max Starter KitThe Mira Max Starter Kit is for those who would prefer more concrete results regarding their ovulation status. While the basic Starter Kit can predict ovulation, the Max Starter Kit can confirm ovulation through the inclusion of wands that also measure PdG.43 Mira Clarity BundleThe description of the Mira Clarity Bundle notes that this bundle is ideal for those looking to conceive after age 35 or who want to see how close they are to menopause. This bundle also includes wands that measure PdG for ovulation confirmation. Mira Confirm BundleInterestingly, the Confirm Bundle measures the same hormones as the Mira Max Starter Kit (LH, E3G, and PdG), but with the hormones split up between two wand types. If you’d like to always know all three hormones with each test you take, then it may be ideal to choose the Max Starter Kit, since you can get 20 Max Wands for the same price as the split-up Confirm Bundle that measures LH and E3G with one wand and PdG with another. So, ultimately, this bundle is for those who do not wish to measure those three aforementioned hormones all at once together. Mira Wands In addition to the wands that come with the kit, you can also purchase 20-packs of replacement wands (with an additional 10-pack option for the Ovum Wands). Currently, Mira offers five types of wands, and each type tests specific hormones. The names of four out of five of the wands are very similar, which can get confusing. The list below breaks down the hormones measured by each wand type.  Mira Fertility Wands: LH Mira Fertility Plus Wands: LH and E3G Mira Fertility Max Wands: LH, E3G, and PdG Mira Fertility Confirm Wands: PdG Mira Ovum Wands: FSH  The Mira Analyzer used to only come with the Mira Fertility Wands that test for LH levels alone. But now even the basic Mira Starter Kit comes with the Fertility Plus Wands that test for both LH and E3G. Clearblue’s testing sticks, on the other hand, only come in one variety and only measure two hormones — estrogen and luteinizing hormone. Modern Fertility tests some of the same hormones as Mira and Clearblue, but it also looks at some thyroid hormones for a broader picture of your health. Pricing Mira’s wands, like its bundles and kits, are HSA/FSA eligible and have the option to be purchased using pay-in-four installment financing. Mira also offers subscription deals for its wands, which can save you up to 10%. And shipping on orders under $148 is about $9 in the U.S. Mira Wand pricing details (and hormones checked, for reference) are in the following chart. Monthly savings are 10% off, while bi-monthly is 5% off. HormonesSingle purchase priceSubscription pricingMira Fertility WandsLH$40.00Monthly $36.00; bi-monthly $38.00Mira Fertility Plus WandsLH and E3G$64.99Monthly $58.49; bi-monthly $61.74Mira Fertility Max WandsLH, E3G, and PdG$89.99Monthly $80.10; bi-monthly $84.55Mira Fertility Confirm WandsPdG$67.99Monthly $61.19; bi-monthly $64.59Mira Ovum WandsFSH$45.00 for 10; $69.99 for 2010-pack: monthly $40.50; bi-monthly $42.75. 20-pack: monthly $62.99; bi-monthly $66.49 In comparison to the cost of Mira Wands, Clearblue’s testing sticks range in price online from $54.99 to $78.57 at the time of this review. How to use the Mira fertility tracker After purchasing your Mira kit or bundle, it should arrive in about 3-6 days according to the company. However, while Mira explains that it tries to ship orders within 2-3 business days, shipping may take longer due to demand. For instance, one of our testers received shipping confirmation (with tracking info) three days after ordering, and the product arrived in discreet packaging a total of eight days after purchase. Once you receive your order, you’ll find that the instructional materials included are thorough and fairly easy to follow. Connecting your analyzer to the Mira app takes only a few minutes, and the app offers many insights into your cycle and fertility. Using the test wands and analyzer is also a simple process, especially if you’ve ever taken an at-home pregnancy test or used a blood glucose monitor. Using the kit The Mira Analyzer and testing wands are packaged separately. The first package contains the analyzer, a zippered carrying case, a charging cord, and a card titled, ""Get Started with Mira."" The testing wand box includes ten wands, a silicone collection cup, and a pamphlet that goes over the basics of the testing process. The booklets that come with the kit include a lot of in-depth information about correctly collecting a sample, including time of day and proper wand handling. We recommend reading the entire booklet and following the instructions carefully to ensure accurate testing results. The following list breaks down the basic steps to completing your first test:  After turning on the Mira Analyzer, use your Apple or Android phone (both are compatible) to scan the QR code that appears on the screen. This will prompt you to download the Mira app. The app will ask a few questions about your cycle and purposes for using Mira for a more personalized app setup. Next, you’ll pair your analyzer with the app using Bluetooth by following the on-screen instructions. This connection process usually takes only a few seconds. Then, to collect your sample, urinate into the silicone collection cup and then insert the sample end of the wand for 10-25 seconds. After sampling, Mira recommends immediately inserting the wand into the Analyzer. The Analyzer screen will display how long it will take for your results to be ready. Generally, our testers found that it takes between 10-16 minutes. When the results are ready, your analyzer beeps and the hormone levels will show in the app on both the home screen and on the chart.  Insider Tip: If you’re unsure about when to test, a green dot on calendar days in the app indicates when you should. Mira app The Mira app provides a comprehensive view of your cycle information and test results, and our testers found it to be user-friendly. Based on the length of your cycle, date of your last period, and testing results, the app provides you with a Fertility Score from 1-10. The higher the score, the more likely you are to conceive on that day. Mira breaks down the scores as follows: Ovulation statusFertility statusConception chanceScore of 1-4Non-ovulatory daysNon-fertile windowUnlikely, but not impossibleScore of 5-8Around three days before or two days after ovulationFertile windowIntercourse or fertility treatments may lead to pregnancyScore of 9-10Ovulation is likely to occur within 24 hoursThe most fertile daysIntercourse or fertility treatments within one or two days have the highest chance of pregnancy Another feature of the app, cycle analysis, displays your cycle and period length, as well as your cycle's luteal and follicular phases. The luteal phase is the time after ovulation before your period starts, and the follicular phase lasts from the first day of your period through ovulation. The chart screen stores your test result information and provides the days of the month that make up your fertile window. You can access the Mira shop from the app and read blog posts, news articles, and success stories on the news screen. Your profile stores your personal information and includes the Mira FAQ, customer support, and troubleshooting assistance. To receive reminders for when to test, you can also set up push notifications. Customer support Mira offers a very thorough FAQ page that includes dozens of articles about using all of Mira’s products. If you end up with a question or concern, one of these articles is likely to have the answer. If you don’t find the answer you’re looking for, you can reach out to customer support directly via email (support@miracare.com) or through the website’s chat option (the little envelope icon at the bottom right of the page). Messages sent to Mira should receive a response within 48 hours, as was the case with our testers. Mira’s additional products In addition to its fertility testing options, Mira sells a collection of various other products to provide additional support to those who are TTC. The only competitor mentioned in this review that offers additional products is Modern Fertility, which sells ovulation tests, pregnancy tests, birth control, and prenatal vitamins. Fertility and pregnancy teas Mira Fertility Tea is an organic, caffeine-free herbal tea made from goji berry, ginger root, chaste tree berries, nettle leaf, raspberry leaf, and peppermint. Mira claims this tea can help naturally support your reproductive system, but research on the ingredients and their relationship with fertility is sparse. (Many of the studies showing benefits were conducted on rodents, not humans.) However, many people find drinking tea to be soothing, and there is some research suggesting that stress reduction may be beneficial to fertility.46 Mira’s Pregnancy Tea is the company’s other organic and caffeine-free herbal tea option. This one is purported to help with common pregnancy symptoms, like nausea, anxiety, heartburn, and more. The ingredients in Pregnancy Tea are similar to those in Fertility Tea, but there are some differences. This tea is made from ginger root, lavender, nettle leaf, oatstraw, rosehips, fennel, and peppermint. As with Fertility Tea, most of these ingredients have sparse research suggesting any benefits. The one outlier is ginger, which has several studies suggesting it’s a fairly effective treatment for pregnancy nausea and digestive upset.31 47 Mira’s tea prices are as follows (both items come with 20 tea bags):  Fertility tea: Single purchase $23.99; monthly subscription $21.59 Pregnancy tea: Single purchase $22.99; monthly subscription $20.69  Menstrual cup The Mira menstrual cup ($19) is for those looking for an environmentally-friendly — and less expensive — alternative to pads or tampons. Because of its silicone construction, the Mira Menstrual Cup, like other menstrual cups, can last for about 2-10 years without replacement. You can also safely wear it for up to 12 hours at a time.48 Additionally, some research suggests that menstrual cups can act as a fertility aid by keeping sperm close to the cervix.16 Basal thermometer For those interested in tracking their basal body temperature as part of their family planning, Mira sells a basal body thermometer for $35. This thermometer connects with the Mira app via Bluetooth to keep track of your temperature readings throughout your cycle. On its own, basal body temperature may not be as reliable, with research stating it’s only about 22% accurate at predicting ovulation.15 But when paired with the rest of the data available from the Mira fertility tracking system, it may prove to be useful. Two competing products, the devices from Ava and OvuSense, use your basal body temperature to predict ovulation. Prenatal vitamins According to the Mayo Clinic and the CDC, if you’re TTC, then you should start taking prenatal vitamins with adequate amounts of folic acid at least three months before conception to prevent birth defects of the baby’s brain (anencephaly) and spine (spina bifida). Essential components of a good prenatal vitamin include iron, folic acid, calcium, zinc, iodine, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, and various other B vitamins.12 49 The Mira Prenatal Multi-Vitamins include almost all of those components, with the exception of iron. Vitamin C may help you better absorb iron, but it might be ideal to speak with your OB-GYN about whether or not additional iron supplementation is recommended if you take Mira’s vitamins.13 Mira Prenatal Multi-Vitamins (60 capsules) can be purchased one time for $27.99 or delivered monthly on a subscription for $25.99. Modern Fertility’s prenatal vitamins include many of the same ingredients as Mira’s, with the addition of iron, omega-3, and biotin. These 60-capsule bottles are $35 per month or $90 for a 3-month supply. Both Modern Fertility and Ritual’s prenatal vitamins include folate in the form “methylfolate,” which is easier for your body to metabolize than Mira’s choice of folic acid.53 Meditation playlist While other methods of increasing conception chances have more research behind them, some research shows that mindfulness-based interventions may improve fertility.17 18 If nothing else, infertility can be stressful, and stress also has some research suggesting that it can negatively impact overall fertility.50 So meditation or other relaxation techniques may be beneficial. Mira's Fertility Meditation Playlist is $4.99 and includes six meditation exercises guided by three women with experience in fertility meditation. Partner products In addition to its branded products, Mira also sells products from its partners — a fertility test for men, a fertility-friendly lubricant, and a device to help you correctly do Kegel exercises. The YO Male Fertility Sperm Test X 2 ($79.95) is a way for users to test the motility and health of their sperm. This can prove to be valuable information, as research shows the partner with male anatomy to be a primary or contributing factor in about 50% of infertility and subfertility cases.11 The YO Male fertility test comes with:  The YO Cube that connects to wifi Two collection cups Two vials of liquefaction powder Two pipettes Two testing slides  Like Mira’s fertility test, it’s fairly easy to use The YO Male one. First, you collect your sample in the collection cup, then add the powder, collect the mixture in the pipette, and place a few drops on the slide. Next, insert the slide into the YO cube. Within a few minutes, the results show motile sperm count, a YO score, customized information about your fertility, and a video of your sperm that you can share with a healthcare professional. The YO mobile app helps to store and track this information. The BioGenesis Fertility Lubricant ($20) is a water-based lubricant that promotes fertility by not harming or slowing down sperm (which some lubricants can cause).19 22 One order comes with 12 applications and two reusable applicators. The final partner product, kGoal Kegels for Women ($149), is a device intended to help those with a vagina train their pelvic floor muscles. While there’s currently no evidence indicating that Kegel exercises can help you get pregnant, there is some research suggesting that they can help make delivering a baby easier.24 As an additional note: partner products can be purchased using the pay-in-four installment financing option (if totaling over $50), but only Mira-brand products can qualify for free shipping. Additional resources At the top of the Mira website, under Fertility 101, you can find a collection of additional resources to help you on your fertility journey. These include:  The Mira blog with articles on getting pregnant, tracking your cycle, hormones, menopause, birth control, LGBTQIA fertility, and much more A collection of 20+ free webinars on fertility hosted by health experts Several free ebooks dedicated to various aspects of fertility, pregnancy, and female hormones A $19.99 Guided TTC Plan online course hosted by doctors, fertility specialists, and moms. Topics include things like the physiology of fertility, doctor’s visits, lifestyle and psychological factors, exercise, sexual health, and more Various discount offers for services such as fertility mentorship, supplements, and nutrition from Mira’s partner companies  Mira’s return policy and warranty Mira’s return policy is fairly strict — the only way for customers to get a full refund is if they cancel the order before the package ships. The company tries to ship orders out within 2-3 business days after you make your purchase, so prompt cancellation is ideal if you decide you no longer want your Mira products. If you wish to return an order that has shipped, then Mira advises you to keep everything “unopened, unused, and original.” Additionally, the policy notes that items should be kept out of direct sunlight and in a dry environment between 39°F and 86°F. To return a shipped order, you’ll have to contact Mira’s support team within 20 days of the products being delivered. Shipping and handling charges are non-refundable, and you’ll have to pay for return shipping unless you opt for a paid return label, which deducts 15% of the original purchase price from your refund. With the exception of Modern Fertility (whose test can’t be returned), all of the other competitors mentioned in this review have return policies that feel much more customer-friendly. For Mira subscriptions, you can cancel or manage them at any time by:  Sending the company an “explicit request at least 48 hours before the next order process date” Locating your order confirmation email and clicking the “manage subscription” option, then “cancel” Logging into your account on the Mira website and navigating to “your subscriptions”  Insider Tip: Pausing your subscription or changing order dates won’t cancel the subscription. Adjustments to your subscription (including canceling) can be made without penalty. And, finally, the Mira Analyzer device has a one-year limited warranty (same as Ava) starting from your purchase date, not the date you receive the device or start using it. If you find that your Mira Analyzer stops working within that time period, the company will either repair or replace the device at its discretion at no charge. This warranty may come in handy, as many of the complaints found across the internet involve the device suddenly not working properly. Alternatives to Mira There are many at-home fertility and hormone monitors on the market — and each one is unique, particularly in how and what they test. Overall, though, all of these products have the same goal: to give you an accurate picture of your fertility health. Here’s how Mira stacks up to the competition. Ava Ava, unlike Mira, is a wearable device. To use Ava, you wear the bracelet while you sleep each night and the device measures your temperature, resting pulse rate, sleep, breathing rate, physiological stress, and more. Ava claims that this allows it to detect — “not simply predict” — the phases of your menstrual cycle. Similar to Mira, this data is stored and tracked via a mobile app. However, Ava also lets you download this data for your own records or to print and share with your healthcare provider. We hope Mira will eventually add this feature to its app, as well. If you experience irregular cycles or have PCOS and need help managing your health, Ava may not provide the type of information you’re looking for, since it doesn’t measure hormone levels like Mira. While Mira can be suitable for anyone with ovaries looking to track their menstrual cycle for any variety of reasons, Ava’s main purpose is to help users discover their most fertile days to aid in conception. For those looking for a completely non-invasive fertility tracker that doesn’t involve any bodily fluids and requires little to no additional time taken out of their day, then Ava could be an ideal option. Ava does have a higher initial price than Mira, but the potential cost of additional Mira Wands could make the price comparable or even lower overall. The choice really comes down to your comfort, what information you’re looking for, and how long you’ll be testing (which is quite often an unknown variable). The prices and details for Ava’s bundles are as follows (all options include free shipping): CostIncludesGuaranteesAva Fertility Basic$279Ava bracelet, app tracking (cycle, fertility, and pregnancy), membership to Ava online communityNoneAva Fertility Plus$309All of the basic bundle features plus an e-bookFull refund if you’re not pregnant within 12 monthsAva Fertility Premium$359All of the basic bundle features plus an e-bookFull refund if you’re not pregnant within 6 months It may seem odd that the more expensive bundle has a shorter refund window, but Ava’s policy requires that you track nearly the entirety of your completed cycles during the specified time. For Fertility Plus, this means tracking 80% for 12 months, and for Fertility Premium it means 90% for six months. So, the higher price of Fertility Premium could very likely be due to having to use the device for a shorter period of time before the refund is available. Insider Tip: For Ava’s return policy, it’s important to know that a “complete cycle” in the company’s eyes means from the first day of your nearest period to the last day before your next one. While this return policy may seem rather strict, it still feels more customer-friendly than Mira’s. And both companies’ devices come with 1-year warranties. Modern Fertility Modern Fertility, formerly a standalone company, was acquired by the telehealth brand Ro (also known as Roman) in 2021. The most significant differences between Mira and Modern Fertility are the sample collection method and the number of hormones tested. Modern Fertility is a blood test — the company sends you lancets to prick your finger and test strips for sending your blood sample back to the lab. This process takes longer than Mira’s 15-minute results and is more invasive. Another difference is the number of and type of hormones each product tests. Modern Fertility looks at seven hormones compared to Mira’s four. The chart below breaks these down. MiraModern FertilityLuteinizing hormone (LH)Oestrone 3 glucuronide (E3G)Pregnanediol 3a glucuronide (PdG)Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)Estradiol (E2)Free thyroxine (fT4)Prolactin (PRL) The Mira Starter Kit and Modern Fertility are similarly priced — $199 and $179, respectively. However, as with Ava, the comparability of Mira’s cost versus its alternatives depends highly on how many Mira Wands you’ll ultimately need. While you can take multiple Modern Fertility tests over time if you wish, it’s not a requirement for getting results. Like Ava, Modern Fertility may not be as ideal as Mira for those with hormonal irregularities or conditions like PCOS who might prefer (and find benefit from) frequent testing with results in a few minutes. Because Modern Fertility is part of a broader telehealth service, you can also choose to be connected to a fertility nurse to discuss your results. Like Mira, Modern Fertility also offers an app and additional fertility health items:  Prenatal vitamins (60 capsules): $35 per month or $90 for three months Ovulation tests (20-pack): $16 for a single purchase or $15 per month Pregnancy tests (4-pack): $14 for a single purchase or $13 per month Birth control (17 pill options): $19 per month on a quarterly basis  OvuSense Like Ava, OvuSense offers wearable devices — two to be precise. Unlike Ava, though, OvuSense devices only automatically track your body temperature fluctuations. To track other data, you’ll need to enter that manually in the OvuSense mobile app. With the information it collects and what you provide, the app reports your perceived fertile window and when or if you’ve ovulated. The company recommends starting off with its OvuFirst sensor, a small disc worn close to the skin using an armband or wristband. If you don’t get pregnant after three months of using OvuFirst, then the company will provide you with a free nurse consultation and an OvuCore vaginal sensor free of charge. And, then, if your OvuCore sensor does not confirm that you ovulated within 90 days of consistent use, then you become eligible for a full refund. This is similarly strict to Ava’s policy, but still beats Mira’s. And unlike Mira and other competitors, OvuSense is a subscription service. Price options are as follows:  OvuSense Flex plan (OvuFirst sensor): $39 per month OvuSense Advanced Fertility Monitor (OvuCore sensor): $35 per month with $99 upfront, $279 per year, or a one-time payment of $399  Clearblue Clearblue offers three different fertility monitors, all of which collect information about your cycle via a urine sample, similar to Mira. The Digital Ovulation Test and Advanced Digital Ovulation Test are very similar to pregnancy tests and look nearly identical to them. Clearblue’s Fertility Monitor with Touch Screen, however, is more akin to Mira’s Analyzer. Clearblue’s Fertility Monitor also uses sticks, which are like Mira’s wands, but they only check two hormones: estrogen and luteinizing hormone. Another difference is how Clearblue’s monitor stores data and provides fertility insights — this is all done with the same handheld touch-screen device that analyzes your samples. While some people may prefer this all-in-one setup, it’s important to know that Clearblue’s monitor only stores up to six of your cycles instead of all your testing data. Clearblue is a fairly well-known, over-the-counter brand. You can buy the fertility monitor online via Amazon, or in retail stores like Walmart or Walgreens. Prices may vary depending on the store. For instance, at the time of writing this review, the monitor is $149 at Walgreens, $120 at Walmart, and $119 at Amazon. Unlike Mira, Clearblue does not come with testing sticks; you’ll need to purchase those separately. Clearblue test sticks are only available in packs of 30 and cost about $55. Because this monitor is sold OTC in various stores instead of directly from Clearblue, return and refund policies will also vary. Mira FAQ Does Mira work?According to research, yes, Mira should work well for most people with ovaries. When compared to the Clearblue fertility monitor (which was found to increase pregnancy rates in a separate study),10 Mira’s fertility tracking system provided nearly identical information. Both monitors were found to provide “an accurate estimate of the fertile window.”7 When do I test with Mira?In the Mira mobile app, your designated test days will be marked on your calendar screen with a green dot. You can also opt to receive push notifications from the app to remind you when to test. Mira notes that your testing frequency can change. For instance, you may be recommended to test every day after your period for a length of time, or it might be every two or three days. What hormones does Mira measure?Mira can currently test for four different hormones in various combinations depending on the Mira Wand you use. The four hormone options include: luteinizing hormone (LH), oestrone-3-glucuronide (E3G), pregnanediol-3a-glucuronide (PdG), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Is Mira HSA/FSA eligible?At this time, Mira does not accept health insurance, but you can use an HSA or FSA debit card to make purchases on the Mira website. Many Mira products are also reimbursable through your HSA or FSA plan. 53 Sources+Innerbody uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Ovusense        Ava Vs Mira Vs OvusenseIn today's market, there are several leading brands offering advanced fertility tracking devices. Among them, Ava, Mira, and Ovusense have gained significant popularity for their accuracy and effectiveness. Each of these devices comes with its own unique features and functions, catering to the diverse needs of women trying to conceive. In this article, we will dive into the details of Ava, Mira, and Ovusense, comparing their functionalities, performance metrics, user interfaces, pricing structures, and overall value for money.Understanding Ava, Mira, and OvusenseBefore we delve into the specific features of Ava, Mira, and Ovusense, let's take a moment to understand what they are and how they work.When it comes to fertility tracking, Ava, Mira, and Ovusense are three popular devices that offer unique features and benefits. These devices are designed to help individuals and couples understand their fertility patterns and increase their chances of conception.Key Features of AvaAva is an innovative fertility tracker that focuses on tracking physiological parameters such as skin temperature, resting pulse rate, and breathing rate. This wrist-worn device uses advanced algorithms to detect your fertile window accurately.One of the key advantages of Ava is that it eliminates the need for manual charting or interpreting complex data. With Ava, you simply wear the device while you sleep, and it collects the necessary data to provide you with insights into your fertility status.By monitoring your physiological parameters, Ava can detect subtle changes in your body that indicate ovulation. This information can help you identify your most fertile days and optimize your chances of conceiving.Key Features of MiraMira takes fertility tracking to the next level by combining an advanced sensor system with a mobile app. The device uses urine-based hormone detection to provide precise insights into your fertility status.Unlike traditional ovulation tests that only detect the surge in luteinizing hormone (LH), Mira measures the actual hormone levels in your urine. This allows for a more accurate understanding of your fertility status.With Mira's mobile app, you can track your hormone levels over time and access personalized fertility predictions. The app also provides tailored recommendations based on your unique hormonal patterns, helping you optimize your fertility journey.Another notable feature of Mira is its ability to sync with other health tracking apps and devices. This integration allows for a comprehensive view of your overall health and fertility, empowering you to make informed decisions.Key Features of OvusenseOvusense differentiates itself with its unique approach to fertility tracking. This vaginal sensor monitors core body temperature continuously, providing highly accurate fertility predictions.Unlike other devices that rely on external measurements, Ovusense directly measures the hormones that signal ovulation. This ensures maximum precision and reliability in predicting your fertile window.By monitoring your core body temperature, Ovusense can detect the subtle changes that occur during your menstrual cycle. This information is then used to accurately predict when you are most likely to conceive.Ovusense also offers a user-friendly app that allows you to track your fertility data and receive personalized insights. The app provides detailed charts and graphs to help you visualize your fertility patterns and make informed decisions.Furthermore, Ovusense offers a supportive community where you can connect with other individuals who are on a similar fertility journey. This community provides a platform for sharing experiences, seeking advice, and finding support.In conclusion, Ava, Mira, and Ovusense are three powerful fertility tracking devices that offer unique features and benefits. Whether you prefer wrist-worn trackers, urine-based hormone detection, or vaginal sensors, there is a device that can cater to your specific needs and help you on your fertility journey.Comparing Functionality and PerformanceFunctionality and performance are key factors to consider when choosing a fertility tracking device.

In this review, we’ll compare ovulation trackers by Ava, Mira and OvuSense to help you decide if a new, technology-enabled ovulation tracker can help you get pregnant. There’s an optimal window of 4 to 7 days each month to try to have a baby. Sounds simple enough — all you have to do is,  you know, get it on during those days. But if you’ve struggled to conceive, you know it’s actually a lot more complicated than that. And the first, surprisingly-hard thing to figure out is when those days are each month. According to the American Pregnancy Association, ovulation for most women occurs anywhere between day 11 to day 21 of their menstrual cycle. That’s a ten day window…which is huge if you are trying to get the timing perfectly right. Ovulation can occur at various times during a cycle, potentially on a different day each month, making things more complicated than it seems. Ovulation is divided into two phases: the follicular phase and the luteal phase. The follicular phase starts on the first days of the last menstrual period (LMP) and continues through ovulation. It can differ greatly for every woman and last from 7 – 40 days. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phases which begins the day of ovulation until the next period begins. This phase is a bit more precise and is usually only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. But of course, all women’s cycles are different. They can be irregularly short or long, include unstable hormones, or even Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). With these irregularities, optimizing the timing for conception can be tricky. Fortunately ovulation trackers have become affordable enough to allow you to know exactly when your fertile and infertile days are coming up next. Aspiring mothers now have a number of technology-driven options. Let’s review three of the most popular ovulation trackers on the market: Ava vs Mira vs OvuSense.                    So which ovulation tracker is the best: Ava, Mira, or OvuSense?     When it comes to conceiving, you want to be sure that you are using the tracker that will work best for you and your body. Fortunately, you have a variety of options to choose from with Ava, Mira, and OvuSense. Beyond the cost differences, there are some meaningful differences in how these devices track and estimate your fertility, ranging from a bracelet, to a urine test, to a vaginal sensor. Let’s dive into how each of them could work for you!

And they all have apps for your phones, making it easier for you to know how your cycle is progressing. Now that we have broken down the trackers by Mira, Ava and Ovusense, let’s explore them each in a bit more detail.                    Review of Ava Bracelet         Image source: Ava      Ava has been pushing to make advancements in the field of women’s health through their flagship product, the Ava bracelet. The company has published a few clinical studies in peer reviewed journals (one example here) that have shown that it can be used to detect and track physiological signals that indicate the most fertile days for a woman in a month: skin temperature, resting pulse rate, heart rate variability, perfusion and breathing rate. We like the fact that Ava is getting real scientific research conducted on their product; the study we looked at was legit, but we’d love to see more research on a larger test group of women. How does Ava’s ovulation tracking bracelet work?With Ava, all you have to do is wear the adjustable ovulation bracelet at night and select your tracking mode: fertility, cycle, or pregnancy. When you wear Ava at night, the sensors in the device collect data 25 times a second. In the morning, when you wake up, you sync the bracelet to the Ava app on your phone. That information is then used to calculate your fertility window, and it will allow you to learn the five best days to conceive in real-time. It will also fill you in on your sleep and stress levels, which may also help you find the best window to make a baby. And once you are pregnant, the Ava bracelet will continue to offer you insights for updates on your physiological stress, sleep patterns, and cardiovascular health.  When you purchase Ava, 20% of your sale will go toward women’s health research and development. In addition to the bracelet and your in-app tracking, you will also become a member of Ava’s exclusive online community. Pretty neat! Ava works best for women who have consistent cycles and can be used for women who are currently breastfeeding, have endometriosis, or are using an alternate conception method. Their device is not for women taking birth control, who have PCOS, who have significant variance in their monthly cycle length — and it’s not intended to be used as a contraceptive device. There are three options you can choose from when purchasing the Ava bracelet — Basic, Plus and Premium — each with slightly  different bells and whistles.

Review of Mira Fertility and Ovulation Tracker         Source: Mira             Founded by Sylvia Kang and Zheng Yang, Mira’s mission is to help women understand and stay on top of their health in the comfort of their own home. As the first comprehensive women’s health tracker, Mira takes the guesswork out of your ovulation cycles by providing you with specific fertility hormone concentration levels. How does Mira’s fertility tracker work?With Mira’s tracker, you will receive the Mira Fertility Analyzer and 10 individually packaged single-use Mira fertility test wands. At the most basic level, you collect a urine sample (so you are peeing into a cup), and you insert a wand into the urine. Then, you put the wand into the Mira device. It will analyze your hormone levels, and after a number of tests, the company says it can predict your upcoming fertility window. The science behind Mira’s tracker is that the device is measuring your hormone levels. The specific hormone that they talk about is the “LH” hormone, or the Luteinizing hormone. This hormone varies during the month depending on when you ovulate. That said, LH typically spikes too late in your cycle for you to time your intercourse — which isn’t helpful. The special science that Mira brings to the equation is that they are able to build a predictive model on your LH cycle, meaning they can hopefully help you predict ahead of time when your ovulation is approaching, so you can hit that special window to conceive. Mira’s algorithms provide you with personalized fertility insights so you can know exactly when your fertile days are.  Mira doesn’t seem to have published as much scientific research as Ava; however, tracking LH is a well-understood and researched tool for understanding ovulation. So, we believe that there is legitimate science behind the Mira device and wands. The trick will be, how well will their patented AI-algorithm can predict your particular fertility window. The company also says that they are working on additional hormone tests for estrogen, which they say will help more exactly measure all fertile days and progesterone, which indicates that ovulation has happened already (Mira says that this may be useful to women who want to avoid pregnancy in a natural way). These additional tests may add to the accuracy of the Mira device’s results. Mira is taking pre-orders for the “Mira Plus,” which includes these two additional tests. You can get on a waiting list for the device here.  Your first order with Mira comes with the analyzer device and 10 test strips/wands, all for $199. You will probably want to purchase additional wands, since you are likely to use 10 to 15 in your first month. Additional wands cost $45 for a 20 pack — something to keep in mind when you are trying to evaluate the all-in cost of Mira’s ovulation kit. In addition, Mira’s app provides an advanced calendar, which records specific health details about your ovulation (including hormone concentration that are as accurate as any lab’s) and cycles so you can predict your fertile windows more precisely. Even if you have irregular cycles, you can still use Mira because you can still see when ovulation happens as long as you ovulate. You may need to test a bit more frequently, but you will still get the same results!                                 Review of OvuSense's Fertility and Ovulation Monitor         Image source: OvuSense             Similar to Ava, OvuSense’s fertility monitor will do all the work for you while you sleep. But what sets OvuSense apart is that it measures your Core Body Temperature (CBT) which allows it to track daily fluctuations in progesterone, a hormone that is released during ovulation and needs to be sustained in the second half of your cycle to help you conceive. With this progesterone pattern, OvuSense uses it to predict your ovulation up to 24 hours in advance, confirm the exact date of ovulation, and monitor your individual pattern from cycle to cycle. Because it uses in cycle data for tracking ovulation versus a calendar-based method, OvuSense is one of the few devices that works for women with irregular cycles or PCOS.  How does the OvuSense ovulation tracker work?To get started, you will insert the OvuSense sensor into your vagina overnight, which will fit comfortably like a tampon. Throughout the night, it will measure your CBT every 5 minutes. In the morning, you will remove and clean the sensor before downloading its data to the OvuSense app. It will take just a few days for OvuSense to be able to predict your ovulation up to 24 hours in advance. Even if you experience irregular cycles, OvuSense will still be able to make an accurate prediction.  So, is OvuSense legit? Well, we do like the fact that the company has published several clinical studies. For example, in the medical journal called Fertility and Sterility, there is a small study of 21 women, the core body temperature fertility monitoring and prediction strategy that the OvuSense devices use showed that it was able to closely track the women’s ovulation cycle. While this isn’t a big study, we like the fact that the company has several studies published and seems to be relying on real science.   How accurate is OvuSense?OvuSense says it will confirm ovulation with 99% accuracy, which can help you diagnose any issues and track the effect of any medication you might be taking. Three days after you ovulate, OvuSense will confirm the exact ovulation date. You can also continue monitoring your progesterone levels during your luteal phase.  The only time you should not use OvuSense is during your period. When you begin again, OvuSense will then predict the 8 days that you are most likely to conceive in the cycle. OvuSense will update the data in real-time during the cycle, replacing the 8-day “long-range” to a 4-day “short-range” window.  Additional benefits of OvuSense is that it works for PCOS, DOR, or any cycle. We think this is a pretty big deal, since women with these conditions can have serious challenges when trying to conceive.  Additionally, when you buy an OvuSense subscription, you will also receive a free fertility nurse consultation after 3 cycles, access to free online clinics from fertility experts, access to a dedicated OvuSense Users Facebook Group. If you want to discuss this with your doctor or partner, it is easy to share the data in real-time through the app.  What is OvuSense Pro?They also just launched OvuSense Pro, which allows you and your doctor to access all your OvuSense cycle information in detail through an online portal. In addition, OvuSense Pro provides key analysis about your cycle patterns. This analysis will help your doctor know whether they need to carry out further tests, how to tailor your treatment if you already have treatment or need it, and to monitor the effectiveness of that treatment.  FYI:  20% of the money spent with OvuSense will go toward funding fertility clinical research and development. If you choose to purchase OvuSense, it’s easy to extend your existing subscription. A 30-day subscription costs $35, and you can renew every 30 days and cancel whenever you like. You can also purchase a 12-month subscription at $210, which is a 50% discount compared to the 30-day subscription. You can save an additional 20% with code FINVSFIN20.                                  What are customers saying about Ava vs Mira vs OvuSense?     Ava’s website debuts multiple success stories and even has a trending hashtag #avawomen to share how Ava has affected them. Ava’s Amazon reviews told a slightly different story, where one of the biggest complaints was the bracelet was very poor at holding a charge. Other reviews said that the bracelet was more useful if you are trying to conceive, rather than helping you understand your cycles. We think that’s great, since we are reviewing the effectiveness of Ava, Mira, and OvuSense for women trying to get pregnant! According to a review on Parentology, “For those only interested in tracking their cycle, the price-point might not be budget-friendly with other apps available on the market. But, if you’re looking to have a baby, then Ava may be a helpful companion in your journey.” However, overall most people really enjoyed the convenience and ease of use with Ava’s bracelet.           As for Mira’s fertility tracker, all reviews were rated a 3 and higher on Reviews.io. For most people the shortcomings of Mira’s product had to do with interpreting the data, the potential for errors to come up on the analyzer, and technical glitches.          But for the most part, everyone is enjoying the results of Mira. Even for women who are currently not looking to conceive, the Mira kit seems to be great at helping them better understand their bodies.                 Finally, there’s OvuSense. Their blog features case studies of women at all stages of their journeys to conceive who talk about the value of the device for learning more about their specific cycle. According to the Happy Healthy Mumma, she “would, without hesitation, recommend OvuSense to anyone wishing to conceive quickly and naturally.”  Some of the more critical reviews of OvuSense come from customers who weren’t able to use the product because they could not activate their subscription (and couldn’t get in touch with support). It’s worth noting that OvuSense offers round the clock technical and chart support seven days a week, plus a dedicated OvuSense Users Facebook Group to assist users as they’re getting started.  For one OvuSense user, she experienced minor issues but ultimately loved the product because of how much she was able to learn about her body by using it.                         The Verdict: Which ovulation tracker should you choose -- Ava, Mira, or OvuSense?     All of these ovulation trackers offer great benefits, providing women with the optimal 5-day fertile window.  Perhaps the biggest difference between these, if you are a normal, otherwise healthy woman who doesn’t have a condition like PCOS, is how you use the Mira, Ava, or OvuSense trackers, and how well they will fit into your current lifestyle. OvuSense requires you to insert the device regularly at night – for some women, this may not be a problem at all; others may find this intrusive. Mira requires you to collect urine samples (something any female who has been to the doctor has had to do!) If you are comfortable with that, then Mira is a very, non-invasive option. Finally, Ava is a bracelet that you need to remember to use every night and synchronize to your phone in the morning. Not challenging to do, but it does require you to remember to use it every evening and to do the sync in the morning.  Mira and OvuSense provide more versatility in that they can be used even if you have PCOS or irregular cycles. However, the Ava bracelet is a more straightforward option that’s effective if your main objective is to simply conceive. If you are willing to splurge a bit, OvuSense will be able to provide you with the most accuracy, in addition to being able to predict your ovulation a full 24 hours in advance.  Mira has a few extra benefits in addition to providing your 5-day fertile window: it also provides information about your hormone, stress, and sleep levels. OvuSense goes above and beyond by measuring your Core body templates using a specifically designed sensor, providing you with more insights about your body’s overall health. At the end of the day, you should choose the tracker that will most help you with what you are looking for, whether that’s tracking your cycles, understanding your body, or having a baby. We love the robustness of OvuSense, but realize it’s relatively expensive. For those on a budget, your choice between Ava and Mira will likely come down to your preference of bracelet vs pee sample. Let us know about your experiences with ovulation trackers in the comments below!

It uses a proprietary algorithm and basal body temperature to calculate the daily menstrual cycle in real time.Many people use it for natural family planning. But some people are interested in Daysy for its cycle tracking capabilities and use as an alternative to hormonal birth control or as a supplement to family planning tools. Here’s what you need to know if you’re considering Daysy.What is Daysy? Daysy is a small medical device that functions as a fertility tracker. It uses your daily temperature to track when you’re most fertile or most likely to conceive during your cycle.The small device takes your temperature each day and pairs with a free app, where you can view information related to your fertility.Daysy pros and consProshormone-freeeasy to usehelps predict ovulationConsnot designed for use as birth controlfertility tracking based on body temperature isn’t fool-proofmust be used dailyusers often experience technical difficultiesif used to prevent pregnancy, it’s less effective than traditional contraceptive methodsWas this helpful?Who is Daysy for?People with a uterus and ovaries can use Daysy. In general, Daysy can be a good resource for people wanting to learn more about their fertility. Knowing when you’re fertile may help increase your chances of conceiving if that’s your goal.While some people like using Daysy’s fertility tracking features as part of their natural birth control method, it’s designed for people who are trying to conceive.How Daysy worksDaysy works by increasing your fertility awareness, so you can make family planning decisions accordingly. During your fertile window, you’re more likely to conceive than on the days outside your fertile window.Daysy uses your basal body temperature and menstruation data to calculate when you’re more likely to conceive and when you’re less likely to conceive. Daysy takes your temperature using a precise sensor, stores your data, and calculates your fertility status. Daysy signals the fertility status using the lights on the device: Red means you’re more likely to conceive. Green means you’re less likely to conceive. Red flashing lights indicate the predicted day of ovulation. Yellow lights can be an indicator of cycle fluctuations or potentially fertile days.How to use DaysyDaysy is simple to use, but it must be used every day. Your results will be most accurate with consistent daily measurements.You’ll use Daysy first thing in the morning before you get out of bed. It’s recommended to get at least 3 to 4 hours of sleep before using Daysy. To use Daysy: Press the activation button once to view your predicted fertility status. Press it again to begin taking your temperature. Remove the protective cap over the sensor and place the sensor under your tongue. Do this while lying down, and don’t engage in any activities before this step. The device will beep when the measurement has been recorded. Part of using Daysy involves recording your menstruation. When you’re on your period, press the activation button until a violet light appears and the device beeps once.In the beginning, Daysy will be in the learning phase. Expect to see a lot of yellow lights as Daysy’s algorithm learns more about your fertility. The more you use Daysy, the more it learns about you.Where to get DaysyDaysy is available to purchase on the company’s website, usa.Daysy.me. It’s also available on: FSA StoreHSA StoreDaysy customer reviews and brand reputationDaysy is rated highly on Trustpilot and Amazon. Customer reviews praise the company for good customer service and warranty. Many customers write about their positive experiences using Daysy to prevent or plan a pregnancy.“This a great alternative if you [are] trying to avoid hormonal birth control,” writes Amazon user Stori Evans. “I am still learning about this device, but after a while, you get the hang of it. It has also helped me learn more about my body.”Other reviews aren’t so positive, saying the company has faulty products, glitches in the app, and high prices. Users report experiencing technical difficulties with the device and app.“It never syncs properly with the app. You have to continue doing it over and over [until] it finally works. When I input information, half the time it doesn’t save. It takes about 2 minutes for it to take your temperature,” explains a reviewer on TrustPilot.A common complaint among users is the high frequency of yellow days, which indicate potentially fertile days or that Daysy is still learning. Some reviewers mention they still became pregnant despite using the device to prevent unwanted pregnancy. That being said, the device is not marketed for pregnancy prevention. Daysy device safetyThere are no physical side effects when using Daysy to track cycles. It’s as safe as taking your temperature with a regular thermometer.

The best option for you depends on your goals, and there’s a possibility that Daysy may not be a fit for you. However, there are other natural birth control methods to consider.A popular alternative to Daysy is simply tracking your cycle and taking your temperature yourself. Tracking and understanding the rise and fall of your basal body temperature throughout your cycle can help you predict the days you’re fertile. Daysy does this for you, but doing it yourself is an option if you have trouble with the app or want a budget-friendly option.If the fertility awareness associated with Daysy is what intrigues you, consider the rhythm method. This involves tracking your menstrual cycle and using the data to predict future cycles and gain a better awareness of your body.PhexxiPhexxi is a newer nonhormonal birth control gel, available by prescription, that’s placed inside the vagina just before penis-in-vagina sex to reduce the risk of pregnancy. It works by preventing semen from changing the pH of the vagina.Natural Cycles appNatural Cycles, or NC, is an app designed for birth control and fertility awareness. Using the NC thermometer and the app’s algorithm, it uses basal body temperature and menstrual cycle to help calculate a user’s fertility status.It was cleared for use as a contraceptive device in 2018 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). How to get started with DaysyGetting started with Daysy is simple.You can start by ordering your Daysy tracker and downloading the app. Before the first use, you’ll need to charge the device. After that, you’ll need to charge it using the USB cable every 1 to 2 months.Daysy comes with everything you need, so you don’t need to purchase anything else. When to talk with a doctorYou can talk to a doctor at any point for advice or to work with you if you’re considering doing natural family planning. Consult your doctor if you’re taking any medications that affect your body temperature. This can interfere with the effectiveness of Daysy.If you’re currently using other forms of birth control given to you by your doctor, check if Daysy is compatible with your existing method. Daysy should not be used while on hormonal birth control.Frequently asked questionsHow accurate is Daysy? Daysy claims to be 99.4 percent accurate. This was confirmed by a study funded by the company. In 2018, unaffiliated researchers found that Daysy wasn’t as accurate as the company claims, and the company’s article was retracted shortly after in 2018. A new study funded by the company in 2020 also found the device to be 99.4 accurate in distinguishing fertile days from infertile days, and still stands.Does insurance cover Daysy? Daysy doesn’t accept health insurance as a form of payment, but you may be able to get a portion of the cost reimbursed by your health insurance plan. It’s also eligible for health savings accounts (HSAs) and flexible spending accounts (FSAs).Is Daysy worth the money? Daysy is pricey, but it’s a one-time expense. Over time, it may be less expensive than ovulation test strips or other tracking devices. If you’re looking for a natural family planning, it may be worth the money to you, but this is subjective. By comparison, if you have health insurance or depending on where you live, the cost of birth control medication may be covered completely, while IUDs can be considered cost effective given that they last for years and are very effective at preventing pregnancy.Can you still get pregnant when you’re not ovulating or when you’re on your period?Yes, you can still get pregnant on your period and outside of ovulation. You can also still get pregnant on birth control, though this is rare, and in other scenarios such as while breastfeeding.TakeawayFor those looking for ways to track their menstrual cycle and fertility, Daysy is one option on the market. However, if you’re not trying to conceive, we don’t recommend it as an alternative to hormonal contraception.There are many other birth control methods, from conventional condoms to other natural or nonhormonal birth control methods.

While many people happen to conceive on one of their first few tries through good timing, just as many people have to work hard to figure out when they’re fertile. That all-important fertile window can be unpredictable and elusive, but fortunately, fertility monitors can help.   Fertility monitors increase the likelihood of getting pregnant because they help pinpoint the best times for intercourse, says Monte Swarup, MD, an Arizona-based OBGYN. The information provided by fertility monitors can help track your cycles to predict fertility and ovulation, making it easier to know when you have your best chance at conceiving. On the flip side, some people utilize fertility monitors to avoid conception without using birth control.   To find the best monitors for various fertility concerns, we talked to experts about which features to prioritize in your shopping search. We researched nearly two dozen kinds of monitors and tested 18 monitors ourselves to find the most user-friendly, accurate products. A double board-certified fertility specialist on our Medical Expert Board also reviewed this article for medical and scientific accuracy.     Types of Fertility Monitors    Fertility monitors work by measuring levels of hormones in your urine, basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, or some combination of these three metrics. There are many different types, including:   Wearable monitors: Wearable monitors include bands worn on your upper arm or wrist, usually overnight, so you don’t have to remember to take your BBT when you wake up. Since your basal body temperature rises soon after ovulation, this fertility monitor is useful for confirming that ovulation has occurred. When used over time, wearable monitors can help you more accurately track your cycles and predict your fertile window.Vaginal monitors: Vaginal monitors are inserted into your vagina for a predetermined length of time. They are designed to measure the quality of your cervical mucus and alert you to increased fertility, signaling it's time to avoid pregnancy or try to achieve it. Urine-testing monitors: You’ll need a set of urine test strips and an electronic reading device for this type of monitor. Once you’ve collected a urine sample, dip the stick in the urine, insert it in the device, and wait for it to give you results. Depending on the device, you may be able to track your LH, progesterone, and estrogen levels to determine where exactly you are in your cycle. Basal body thermometers: This type of monitor works in the same way as a wearable monitor, except you don’t actually wear it. You simply take your temperature orally first thing in the morning before getting out of bed, the same way you would with any other oral thermometer. It’s less convenient than a wearable device but much less expensive.             Best Overall      Tempdrop Fertility and Ovulation Tracker             Amazon      View On Amazon  $169  View On Tempdrop.com  $215       Why We Like It    The Tempdrop Fertility and Ovulation Tracker provides an advanced way to track your basal body temperature (BBT) and get a bird’s eye view of your fertility, no matter your conception goals. Your BBT is your at-rest body temp. It rises after you ovulate, which makes it one of the most well-known ways to understand changes in your fertility throughout your menstrual cycle. Tracking BBT can be helpful for people trying to achieve or avoid pregnancy.   BBT usually needs to be taken first thing in the morning, but that can be difficult for people who have an irregular sleep pattern, says Miriam Bernstein, MD, OBGYN with Oneida Healthcare. That's why we love the Tempdrop. You don't need to remember to take your temperature daily. Instead, simply attach the sensor to your upper arm using the flexible and extendable armband, go to sleep, and wake up in the morning to a night’s worth of temperature readings you can add to the Tempdrop app.   On the technical side of things, the Tempdrop is comfortable to wear and saves your BBT data in the sensor for 30 days. The app also lets you log other signs of fertility or menstruation. With the premium upgrade, the app can interpret your data and offer fertility window predictions.    It's Worth Noting    It’s on the pricier side when it comes to fertility monitors. You'll need the app to view your results.    Product Details    Type: WearableWhat’s included: Tempdrop sensor, armband and extender, battery, battery replacement tool, user manualTracks: Temperature, sleep habitsApp: YesFDA-approved: No           Best Affordable      iProven Digital Basal Thermometer             Amazon      View On Amazon  $10       Why We Like It    If taking your daily BBT is an important part of your fertility tracking, but you don’t have the budget for a fancy wearable thermometer like the Tempdrop, the iProven Digital Basal Thermometer is a reliable, no-frills solution. It takes a reading in just 60 seconds, a timeframe that makes a difference when you’re lying in bed first thing in the morning and itching to get up and start your day.    You won’t get any fancy results or app synchronization with this thermometer, but you will get a protective case, a spare battery, and the freedom to use any app or pen-and-paper chart you choose. Offering temperature readings to the 100th degree where other thermometers typically only go to the tenth, the iProven is more accurate than its competitors. It also comes in at less than $10, making it a budget-friendly option that doesn’t skimp on usefulness.    It's Worth Noting    It’s low-tech, meaning there's no backlight or app synchronization.    Product Details    Type: ThermometerWhat’s included: Thermometer, plastic case, extra batteryTracks: TemperatureApp: NoFDA-approved: Yes           Best Wearable      Ava Fertility Tracker                View On Avawomen.com      Why We Like It    The Ava Fertility Tracker is a wearable thermometer similar to the Tempdrop, except for a few key differences. To start, it’s about $100 more expensive, but the increase in price makes sense when you account for the fact that it collects more data. In addition to temperature, the Ava monitors other physical signs, like heart rate, breathing rate, and rate of perfusion (or how much blood is flowing through your body tissues). It’s also worn on the wrist rather than the upper arm and was the first wearable temperature tracker approved by the FDA.   The other main difference between the Ava and the Tempdrop is app usage. You can use the Tempdrop app in a limited capacity to store and view your data, but can’t receive fertility prediction info unless you upgrade your account. In contrast, your purchase of the Ava bracelet includes a certain number of months of prepaid app usage already built in.    It's Worth Noting    The wrist placement of the bracelet is comfortable but not ideal for detecting an accurate basal body temperature.

It can’t remind you to take your daily BBT, but it does virtually all the other work for you.   The Daysy doesn’t just take your temperature and spit out a reading. Instead, it records your data and uses a special algorithm to determine what those readings mean about your fertility. Rather than simply giving you a temperature degree and leaving you to figure out what to do with it, the Daysy uses a color-coded fertility status system spelling out how fertile (or not) you are.   It also comes with its own app, so you can crunch your numbers across digital ovulation charts, share your info with your partner or fertility doctor, and track other fertility signs like cervical mucus and menstruation.    It's Worth Noting    It’s the most expensive option on this list.    Product Details    Type: ThermometerWhat’s included: Daysy thermometerTracks: TemperatureApp: YesFDA-approved: Yes           Best Digital      Clearblue Fertility Monitor              Amazon      View On Amazon  $120  View On Walgreens  $150  View On Walmart  $120       Why We Like It    All the experts we interviewed say test strips that detect the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine are the most effective and accurate way to monitor ovulation. Digital monitors like the Clearblue Fertility Monitor have the benefit of being an in-hand device that can read your test strips and help you understand your results. Reproductive and endocrinology specialist Shahin Ghadir, MD, of Southern California Reproductive Center, says this monitor is accurate and good at narrowing down the information his patients need to track ovulation.    We love that the device features a large, user-friendly touch screen that clearly displays your chances of conceiving. While other devices rely on an internet connection, this one does not, making it especially good for travel. The device also gives you your testing window, making it easier to use if you can’t remember when you last tested or when you’re due for your next test.     It's Worth Noting    The cost doesn’t include any test strips, so that’s a separate expense you’ll need to budget for.     Product Details    Type: Digital monitorWhat’s included: One digital monitorTracks: Estrogen, luteinizing hormoneApp: NoFDA-approved: No           Best Testing Strips      Easy@Home Ovulation Test Strips and Pregnancy Test Strips Combo Kit              Amazon      View On Amazon  $20  View On Target  $20  View On Walmart  $20       Why We Like It    If you like the idea of testing your urine for hormone surges but not the idea of spending a lot of money on a digital monitor or meager numbers of test strips, this 50-count pack of Easy@Home Ovulation Test Strips is the perfect compromise.    The testing process is the same as it is for any other ovulation testing kit that includes a monitor, except there's no monitor. Instead, you can view your results on the strip its elf after five minutes. It works a lot like a pregnancy test. Two lines mean you’re coming up on your fertile window (and the darker that second line, the higher your LH levels), while one line means your hormone levels are still low.   If this sounds a little confusing, Easy@Home has that covered, too. Their ovulation predictor app makes it easy to manually input or scan your test strip results to interpret your hormone levels. As a bonus, the kit includes 20 HCG strips, so you can test for pregnancy from one month to the next.    It's Worth Noting    If you’re looking for more comprehensive fertility testing or interpretation of your results, these strips won’t give it to you.

You can learn to assess the quality of your cervical mucus manually, but not everyone has the time (or the stomach) to do it themselves. If that sounds like you, the kegg Fertility Tracker is worth considering.   This tracker detects the quality of your cervical mucus by measuring the electrolytes in your mucus and sending that data to the kegg app, which analyzes your data and predicts your fertile window. Notably, the kegg can do this all in two minutes. Just insert it into your vagina according to the instructions, wait for it to take its reading, then sync it to the app for results.   The kegg serves another unrelated but helpful purpose: It can coach you through a brief set of Kegel exercises each day, which strengthen your pelvic floor and may even improve the accuracy of your mucus reading.    It's Worth Noting    You need to be comfortable inserting a device into your vaginaFactors like intercourse, menstruation, and vaginal creams or medications can interfere with cervical mucus readings.

Instead of seeing the results of your urine sample on a digital touchscreen monitor, you clip and sync the Inito to your iPhone, open the Inito app, and gain access to detailed fertility charts and conception recommendations.    The real standout feature of the Inito is its ability to measure estrogen, luteinizing hormone, and progesterone (most ovulation test strips don’t check progesterone levels). Higher levels of progesterone can confirm that ovulation occurred. Inito strips signal when you're fertile (or are about to be), and they can also give you the peace of mind that comes with knowing you've probably ovulated. The other good news? You only need one test strip to acquire all this info, not separate strips for each measurement.    It's Worth Noting    You’ll need a compatible iPhone to connect the device and view your data.

Just pee on a stick, like you do for a pregnancy test, lay it on a flat surface for a few minutes, and get your results.    Stix tests are easy to read, and the all-important second line that confirms a surge in ovulation hormones appears within a distinctly different heart-shaped window than the control line. If you don't want to mess with urine collection or frequently clean a digital monitor, the convenience and ease of use of the Stix kit are hard to beat.     It's Worth Noting    You only get seven sticks per box, so they’re not as cost-effective as many other test strips.

It tracks LH, estrogen, and progesterone levels to create a color-coded chart of your ovulation patterns each month. We selected this kit as our top pick for irregular cycles due to its comprehensive testing and top-notch accuracy. Our editor had just had a blood test with her OBGYN the previous week, and the kit numbers were right on track with her blood test results.   This kit is high-tech, and we relied on the instructions pretty heavily the first few times we used it. However, once you get the hang of it, it's a user-friendly experience, especially when you consider how much data you receive. There's an egg-shaped analyzer that's charged via a micro USB cable, and the kit also comes with a box of wands. To track fertility, you can sync the analyzer with the app and insert the wands for results. The charts are easy to interpret, and we love the visuals that illustrate hormone levels at different stages of your cycle.    It's Worth Noting    It takes 21 minutes to get results, which may be a long time to wait if you have busy mornings or want to take multiple tests.

There's no monitor included, but it's a practical (and affordable) option if you only need to track ovulation. It only takes five minutes to get results, and the display is easy to read and interpret. If the results line is the same as or darker than the control line, the instructions say you will probably ovulate within the coming 24-36 hours. There weren't any tests that left us wondering if something was or wasn't positive.   We found the instructions easy to read and also appreciated the visual information provided, such as a helpful chart that provides recommendations for when to test based on your cycle patterns. To take the test, simply insert the end of the stick into your urine stream for the designated amount of time, then wait five minutes for results. You get seven sticks per box at a great price of less than $20, so they're a budget-friendly option, too.    It's Worth Noting    It only measures LH levels, so isn't the best choice for people with irregular cycles. There's no app to track results.

FSH levels indicate egg quality, which is why FSH is a good marker to track if you're trying to conceive.   Despite the impressive amount of data the monitor provides, the testing process is simple. Just dip the test strip into your urine for 10 seconds, then wait 10 minutes for results. We love that you can set up notifications on the app that tell you when you need to test. The results were consistently accurate and easy to interpret when we tested the monitor, and the app made it easy to track the entirety of our cycle to get the best possible picture of when we ovulated.    It's Worth Noting    The app provides a lot of information and might be a bit too comprehensive if you just need a simple way to track ovulation.

Our experts generally prioritized simplicity of use and accuracy over cost and type, noting that the best fertility monitor is one you will reliably use. With that in mind, we opted for a mix of different types of monitors, including everything from urine test strips to wearable devices to thermometers, and also covered a wide range of pricing. If a monitor was expensive, we didn’t necessarily rule it out, but we did make sure it was worth its price tag in terms of convenience and accuracy.   We also tested three of the products on our list and rated them based on the following factors:   Accuracy: We tracked whether the results of each test aligned with our signs and symptoms of ovulation, as well as any other tracking methods we had been using before the testing period began.Ease of Use: We rated each test for how easy it was to use and how clearly the instructions explained the process. We also noted how user-friendly the connected app or online tracker was, where applicable.Speed of Results: We compared the time it took to obtain results to the time listed in the instruction manual. We also noted if the test took longer than 5-10 minutes, which might make it impractical for busy schedules.Consistency: We tested each monitor over multiple cycles and noted whether or not each one provided consistently accurate results.Value: At the end of the testing period, we checked the product's price and rated each monitor based on how well the price reflected the monitor's quality and accuracy.     Our Experts    Experts we spoke to included:   Monte Swarup, MD, an Arizona-based OBGYNMiriam Bernstein, MD, OBGYN with Oneida HealthcareShahin Ghadir, MD, of Southern California Reproductive Center     What to Know About Fertility Monitors    What Fertility Monitors Are:  A fertility monitor is any device you utilize to predict your fertile window and pinpoint the optimal time to try to conceive.  How Fertility Monitors Work: Fertility monitors have different ways of determining your fertility, but they all rely on taking readings of your BBT, cervical mucus, or urine-based hormone levels and then reporting that data back to you either in an app or on the device itself. Most monitors track one type of data (for example, thermometers determine your BBT). You may want to utilize more than one type of monitor for maximum accuracy when predicting your fertile window.  Accuracy: The experts we interviewed say luteinizing hormone (LH) testing strips are generally the most accurate way to pinpoint your fertile window. Many of these products claim to have an accuracy rate in the high 90s, but no monitor is 100% accurate, says Dr. Bernstein. A monitor can’t diagnose or address underlying medical problems like blocked fallopian tubes, low-quality sperm, uterine abnormalities, egg quality, uterine fibroids, or number of follicles. Inconsistencies in how you use your chosen fertility monitor—like taking LH readings at the wrong time or skipping BBT readings—can also decrease any monitor’s effectiveness. Using a monitor in consultation with your care provider will always yield the most accurate results. Privacy Concerns: When Roe v. Wade was overturned in the spring of 2022, many people had concerns about how their fertility data might be used if they chose to upload it to an internet-based app. There are some privacy concerns to be aware of, says Dr. Swarup, since millions of people use these apps to help track menstrual cycles and don’t know how their data is being used. There’s no evidence that data is being sold by fertility apps, but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen. You should be as cautious with fertility apps as you are about any other app where you willingly share your private and personal health information. Always read the app's disclosures and privacy statements before you click, “I consent,” and reach out to the makers of these apps if you have any security concerns.     Your Questions, Answered     What’s the best way to track fertility?    According to Dr. Swarup, LH test sticks are the most reliable tool because they can detect when your ovaries are releasing an egg, which gives you about 12 to 36 hours to attempt conceiving. Other long-term methods, like BBT thermometers, can also track your fertility by capturing how your cycle changes over time.     Do fertility monitors work?     Most fertility monitors do what they claim to do reasonably well, but Dr. Swarup warns they are still not 100% accurate in guaranteeing conception or preventing a pregnancy. Plus, many outside factors can interfere with the data they give you, such as lack of sleep, illness, or a more serious reproductive issue. Getting a useful picture of your fertility and reproductive health often involves tracking several signs of fertility or, better yet, consulting with a fertility specialist.

Thankfully, Femtech tools provide essential information about your unique menstrual cycle and track numerous physiological parameters which help indicate your best days for TTC. Here, we’ll review the 5 best fertility monitors and ovulation trackers for 2021. We’ve included ovulation predictor kits, wearable technology, and standard BBT trackers on our list so that you can see the leading options available today. TL;DR: What is the Best Ovulation Tracker?  Mira Fertility Tracker is the best ovulation predictor kit. It comes in the form of a urine-based test paired with an analyzer that tracks your numeric LH and estrogen hormone levels. The best fertility bracelet is the Ava Fertility Tracker. It tracks 5 major physiological parameters including skin temperature, resting pulse rate, heart rate variability ratio, perfusion, and breathing rate. The OvuSense Fertility Monitor is the best ovulation monitor on the market. Women insert a vaginal sensor and wear it overnight to continuously measure their core body temperature (cCBT). This data is then analyzed by the OvuSense app to predict ovulation up to 24 hours in advance with 99% accuracy. Kegg Tech’s 2-in-1 Fertility Tracker is the best kegel exerciser. It’s inserted vaginally for 2 minutes each day to monitor electrolyte level changes within cervical mucus and can also be used for kegel exercises. Ovacue Fertility Monitor by Fairhaven Health is the best ovulation monitor for PCOS. It combines readings from both an oral and a vaginal sensor that measure changes in electrolyte levels in your saliva and cervical mucus.  First, What is Femtech?  Femtech (female technology) encompasses a wide range of technology and devices that are designed to support women’s health. In more recent years, Femtech has become a critical component of women’s reproductive health, most notably in the realm of understanding each woman’s unique menstrual cycle and how it may affect their chances of conceiving. Numerous tests and trackers have been developed to help detect women’s fertile windows and pinpoint ovulation. Examples of Femtech devices created for this purpose include:  Smartphone apps, such as ovulation predictors and menstrual cycle calendars Wearable devices, such as ovulation bracelets Insertable devices, such as vaginal monitors  Let’s take now take a quick look at how these tests work and the types of data their predictions are based upon. What Is a Fertility Tracker? A fertility monitor or fertility tracker is an electronic device that helps you track your fertile window and increase the chances of conceiving. This device allows you to track different body parameters that signal ovulation, such as:  hormonal changes in your urine or saliva; the fluctuations of your basal temperature; the electrical resistance of saliva or vaginal fluids.  Instead of trying to figure out the most suitable days to conceive on your own, you can just use a special device that will do the work for you. Besides, almost all modern fertility monitors can be synchronized with a mobile app, and hence, provide you with a detailed record of your cycles, which you can discuss with your gynecologist. How Do Fertility Monitors Work? To answer this question, let’s briefly walk through the processes that happen in a woman’s body prior to, during, and after ovulation. According to science, ovulation typically happens between the 11th and 21st day of the menstrual cycle. During this period, the levels of the luteinizing hormone (LH) go up, triggering the release of the most mature egg from the follicle. Along with that, estrogen levels begin to drop, and progesterone — the hormone that helps stabilize the uterine lining so that the fertilized egg can stick to it — takes the lead. The basal body temperature — also known as the temperature of the resting body — rises before and during ovulation under the influence of LH and progesterone. These are the main body changes that happen during the ovulatory phase of your cycle. So, the purpose of a fertility tracker is to track and monitor these changes to determine the days when chances of conception are the highest. Best Ovulation Tracker Trying to decide which ovulation tracker is best is a hotly debated subject and relies upon several factors. While some women prefer to use standard methods of testing, such as relying on urine tests or tracking BBT, other women may prefer the use of wearable devices that are easy to use, are non-invasive, and reduce some of the stress that’s associated with taking manual measurements. However, there are women who may prefer the use of vaginal monitors which typically provide the most accurate and comprehensive results in comparison to other trackers but are slightly more expensive. Most tests use one of the following ways for estimating or detecting ovulation and the overall likelihood of conception:  Urine Test – This form of testing is used to detect numeric hormone levels, such as Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and estrogen. A sharp LH surge indicates that ovulation will occur within the next 1-2 days. Additionally, an increase in estrogen is also linked to a woman’s fertile window. External/Wearable Device – A device is worn externally that monitors body temperature and in some cases additional physiological parameters, which fluctuates throughout a woman’s menstrual cycle and indicates whether or not a hormonal surge has occurred or is nearing. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) – Women record their basal temperature immediately upon waking with an oral thermometer and track their readings daily throughout the month in order to determine the exact date of ovulation. This form of testing may also be used for predicting their upcoming fertile window Internal Device (Vaginal) – A device is inserted vaginally that records core body temperature data. This form of temperature-tracking is more accurate than that of Basal Body Temperature (BBT) or readings taken externally, such as on the wrist or under the armpit.    Comparison of the 5 Best Fertility Monitors and Ovulation Trackers Best Ovulation Predictor Kit – Mira Fertility Tracker  The Mira Fertility Tracker is an ovulation predictor kit (OPK) that allows women to test their quantitative estrogen and LH hormone levels from the comfort of their home. Both hormones are correlated with ovulation and peak fertility and prior to ovulation, estrogen levels steadily increase and a sharp surge of LH indicates ovulation is about to take place within 1-2 days. These numbers combined provide women with a 6-day fertile window that’s optimal for conception. Mira recognizes that each woman has their own unique ovulatory patterns and that many women have issues with using standard fertility apps. Most generic apps don’t take into account hormone levels, abnormal cycles, or other critical information that affect ovulation and impact trying to predict the optimal time to try to conceive. Mira Fertility Tracker Options Currently, there is 1 option available for the Mira Fertility Tracker – the Mira Fertility Plus Starter Kit. This kit contains the Mira Analyzer and comes with 10 estrogen + LH testing wands. However, women can also purchase additional testing wands in sets of 20. Here’s a closer look at what’s included in each starter kit:    How to Use Mira Fertility Tracker  The Mira Fertility Tracker is extremely user-friendly and the entire testing process takes no more than 20 minutes.  First, you will need to collect a urine sample in the morning with one of the provided urine cups. Following the urine collection, you will then need to dip one of the testing wands into the sample for around 10 seconds. After dipping the wand into the urine sample, remove it and place it into the tracker for analysis. This process usually takes around 15 minutes to complete. Once the analysis has finished, the app will provide personalized information about a woman’s fertile window, such as their hormone baseline levels, and how their hormone surges correlate to ovulation.  This information is critical for knowing exactly when a woman should try to conceive and also enables women to have a better understanding of their own unique cycle. Mira Fertility Tracker Pricing The Mira Fertility Plus Starter Kit comes with 10 estrogen and LH wands along with the Mira Analyzer for $199. Additionally, Mira offers a payment plan through Sezzle for US and Canadian customers with a 25% down payment and interest-free, 25% biweekly payments for those who are unable to pay the full $199 initially. Additional costs associated with the Mira Fertility Tracker include replacement test wands which include a set of 20 estrogen and LH wands for $59. Thankfully, Mira is HSA/FSA eligible for most plans and can be used during checkout to reduce the final cost. Some HSA/FSA plans may even cover the full cost. Mira Fertility Tracker Reviews Overall, most women who have used the Mira Fertility Tracker have left incredibly favorable reviews on the website. REVIEWS.io states that 96% of reviewers recommend Mira Fertility and the company has an overall rating of 4.6/5.0 stars based on 836 reviews. Best Fertility Bracelet – Ava Fertility Tracker  The Ava Fertility Tracker provides women with a hassle-free, non-invasive way to track their fertile window and detect ovulation. This fertility bracelet is designed to measure 5 physiological signals of fertility that are used towards detecting a woman’s 5-day fertile window. Ava is designed to be worn during the night and then synced with its app in the morning.

Ava Fertility Tracker Options Ava Fertility offers the following 3 plans for its fertility bracelet:  Ava Basic – This starter plan includes the Ava bracelet, Ava app, membership to the Ava online community, and free shipping.

Upon waking, women can sync the bracelet with the app to upload the data obtained overnight and allow Ava’s algorithm to display their results immediately.  It’s important for women to wear the bracelet every night during their entire menstrual cycle in order to capture all of the physiological changes that occur that may impact their ovulation and overall fertility. The Ava Bracelet collects data on the following 5 parameters throughout the night which are used towards detecting a woman’s fertile window, predicting the exact day of ovulation, and providing a better look at their overall health:    Ava Fertility Tracker Pricing Ava Fertility provides women with relatively affordable options for clinically-backed wearable sensor technology. The least expensive option available is the Ava Basic plan, which costs $259, and the most expensive option is the Ava Premium plan, which is priced at $359. The major differences between these plans are the inclusion of a free e-book with the premium plan along with a guaranteed full refund if a woman fails to conceive after trying for 6 months. However, most women choose the Ava Plus plan as it provides the best overall value and also offers a full refund if pregnancy is not achieved after trying for 12 months.

This ovulation tracker comes in the form of an easy-to-use OvuCore sensor that is vaginally inserted prior to sleeping and taken out immediately upon waking. The OvuCore sensor pairs with the OvuSense App and provides data in real-time which is used towards predicting ovulation up to 24 hours in advance as well as for providing a full 8-day fertile window at the start of a woman’s following menstrual cycle. This form of ovulation tracking is considered to be more accurate than other trackers and provides better data on temperature when compared to BBT or wearable sensors. OvuSense Fertility Monitor Options OvuSense offers 3 major plans for its fertility monitor starter pack. Women can choose between a monthly or annual plan and also can select from the standard or pro plan, depending on whether or not they’re currently working with a doctor or are planning to in the near future. Here’s a further look into the starter pack options available for OvuSense:  How to Use OvuSense Fertility Monitor Unlike other trackers, the OvuSense Fertility Monitor is an internal monitor that should be worn overnight. Here’s an overview of how it works:  The OvuCore sensor is inserted vaginally and worn during the night. Upon waking, the OvuCore sensor should be removed and thoroughly cleaned prior to syncing with the OvuSense app. The OvuSense app will provide live updates on predicting ovulation and will allow women to know up to 24 hours in advance of their expected day for ovulation. The app will also provide women with their 8-day fertile window for their upcoming cycle to further increase their chances of conceiving.  OvuSense Fertility and Ovulation Monitor Pricing Similar to Ava Fertility, OvuSense offers 3 options for its OvuCore Starter Pack. The least expensive option is the OvuCore Standard Monthly plan which is priced at $129. The most popular option is the standard annual plan which is available for $299, however, there is also another annual plan available for $449 that provides further and more advanced analysis along with remote monitoring for doctors. Additionally, women who are already subscribed to OvuSense may choose to extend their subscription for the following discounted rates:  OvuSense Fertility Monitor Reviews Although there are only 30 reviews currently available, Trustpilot provides OvuSense with an overall 4.2 rating. 83% of reviewers have provided either great or excellent ratings about the fertility monitor and have left comments such as the following: “Ovusense has helped me to fully understand how my body is working and where we may have been going wrong previously… I would use Ovusense every time when trying to conceive” -Nicola B. “I started using the OvuSense device in January 2019 and my son was conceived on the fifth cycle. At 39 and 50 my partner and I had been having no success in conceiving and had begun to put it down to biology but using OvuSense allowed us to pinpoint ovulation and identify that I had a slightly short luteal phase. ” -Laura Abbott “Taking my temperature any other way, never worked for me. I never knew if I was doing it right. But with OvuSense, it did all the hard work for me. Wearing the sensor every night was so simple. Doctors didn’t think I ovulated. I learned with OvuSense that I actually did ovulate and by the second cycle knew when to baby dance to try to have a baby.” -Amy W. Best Kegel Exerciser  What if we told you that we included a device that serves as both a fertility tracker and kegel exercise ball on our list? Kegg Tech designed its 2-in-1 Fertility Tracker for women to use not only to track their fertility but to use for pelvic floor exercises as well! Kegg detects your fertile window by monitoring changes in the levels of electrolytes within your cervical fluid throughout the month.  All you have to do is insert Kegg Tech vaginally for 2 minutes and pair it with its mobile app. Women can choose to perform kegel exercises prior to obtaining their cervical fluid measurements as well to strengthen their pelvic floor and also ease the data collection process by increasing cervical fluid. Best Fertility Monitor for PCOS – Ovacue Fertility Monitor  Another model in this review of the best fertility monitors uses saliva and cervical mucus testing to determine your fertile window. This eliminates the need for buying test strips — which is good for both your wallet and our planet — while still giving you the precise results you need. So, the monitor has two sensors, oral and vaginal, and detects estrogen-impacted electrolyte changes in the corresponding fluids. First, you need to use an oral sensor to determine the changes in the electrolyte resistance in your saliva. After a couple of days, the app can make a trend based on your recordings, marking the beginning of your fertile window (blue squares on the calendar) and predicting low or high chances of ovulation (light and dark blue shades, respectively). After your fertile window begins, you may want to start using the vaginal sensor as well. This sensor will detect the switch from estrogen to progesterone dominance in your cervical fluid, which is the sign that ovulation has occurred. The pink box, indicating ‘possible ovulation’ will appear on the calendar. The Ovacue works for women with irregular cycles and offers you up to 7 days of advance notice. The Verdict – Which Ovulation Tracker is Best for Me? Choosing which of the above ovulation trackers is best for you depends on several factors, such as price limit, ease of use, and overall comfort. If you’re searching for the best ovulation predictor kit, we suggest using the Mira Fertility Tracker. This form of ovulation testing is non-invasive and is the most affordable option from the trackers we reviewed above. If you would rather try wearable technology, we highly suggest the Ava Fertility Tracker. Ava’s fertility bracelet should be worn overnight and tracks 5 major physiological parameters that are used to predict ovulation and provide a detailed overview of a woman’s overall health. Women who want a high accuracy sensor should use the OvuSense Fertility Monitor. This tracker involves the use of an insertable vaginal monitor that records cCBT and is used towards predicting an 8-day fertile window. If you want to use a vaginal monitor that only has to be worn for 2 minutes a day and can also be used for kegel exercises then we recommend Kegg Tech. However, if you happen to have PCOS or experience irregular menstrual cycles, then Ovacue Fertility Monitor is a better option as it monitors changes in electrolytes within both saliva and cervical mucus.   Frequently Asked Questions What type of fertility monitor is the best? According to science, the most precise ovulation predictions come from the fluctuations in the levels of hormones. So, technically, the best type of fertility monitor is the one that uses these measurements. How accurate are fertility trackers? Well, there’s no such thing as ‘the most accurate fertility monitor’, because each woman’s body is unique. Yet, every type of fertility tracker on the market today can offer you a very high level of accuracy to help you get pregnant. How long do I have to track my fertile window? As long as it takes you to conceive a baby. Or, to determine possible fertility issues — in case this method of tracking didn’t bring you the result you expected. Will a fertility monitor work for women who are more than 30 years old? You can use a fertility tracker as long as you are fertile — meaning as long as you have regular menstruations and your healthcare specialist doesn’t detect any issues. Moreover, even if you have an irregular cycle, a fertility monitor can still help you track hormonal changes, and it will do this more accurately than a regular ovulation kit.
