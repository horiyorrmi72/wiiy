This is because people with PCOS may experience multiple LH peaks or variations within spikes that last a couple of days. OPKs and other trackers on the market lack the numerical, real-time data Mira offers—causing missed peaks and false positives.              Tracking E3G, LH, PdG, and FSH at once gives you the complete picture Test through urine with Mira and get the same accuracy you would get from the lab (up to 100%). Monitor 4 key fertility hormones (LH, E3G, PdG, FSH) for the most complete picture of your fertility.        LH Predict your ovulation accurately        E3G Identify your full 6-day fertile window        PdG Confirm ovulation happened during a specific cycle        FSH Understand your fertility status and health         How come Mira works and OPKs don’t? Many people predict their ovulation using regular OPKs and soon find out they are getting faulty information. In comparison, Mira predicts your ovulation and fertile window based on your personalized hormone maps.           Capture higher hormone ranges compared to OPKs and other trackers.    Get numbers & patterns even if your LH baseline is high.    See your complete pattern of LH peaks even if you have multiple ones.    See real-time results about your body, instead of relying on an average number with OPKs.    Manage hormone imbalances by picking up on the slightest changes in your cycles.   Say “no more” to false positives and confusing test results   Try Mira      Want to learn how the Mira Fertility Tracker can help you?

First month I used it I managed to pinpoint ovulation perfectly and conceived first month after trying for 12 months. Thank you Mira Joanne A.

With Mira, you can see your actual hormone concentrations. As long as you ovulate, you will be able                 to know when you ovulate—even with irregular cycles.                      I'm trying to get pregnant. How can Mira help me?                      People trying to conceive don’t always know when their most fertile days are. Researchers found that                 only 12.7% of people with ovaries know when they ovulate correctly, and only 55% estimated their                 ovulation within their fertile window. Mira tracks key fertility hormone concentrations to give you                 personalized insights and maximizes your chances of conceiving.                      I have PCOS, can Mira help me?                      **Based on a 2020 user survey, respondents who identified as having PCOS and used Mira for 3 cycles                 reported a 52.7% pregnancy rate. This is nearly double the typical 26.7% pregnancy rate over 3 cycles                 often cited for those with PCOS, even when using non-quantitative ovulation predictors.                      How many wands do I need per cycle?                      10-20 per cycle are required based on testing day recommendations from the Mira App. With the starter                 kit you will get 10 wands to understand how they work for you. Then you can easily refill wands here.                      How Mira’s technology is different?                      Mira uses lab-grade technology to measure key fertility hormones through urine. Did you know scientists                 use fluorescence-based tech at the fertility lab? So does Mira. We use immunochromatography with                 fluorescence labeling. Our approach offers 99% accuracy without pricking, travel time, or spending                 thousands of dollars.

We’re a team of biologists and engineers who believe that science and technology should be used to improve patients’ lives. We use the latest developments in science and technology to give patients laboratory-grade, real-world data that they can easily track and use. Patients can share this valuable knowledge with their healthcare providers to help them make more personalized health decisions.             Our Partners                                           Recent News       How Mira can help with your practice  The Mira Fertility tracking system is a palm-sized fertility hormone monitoring system with smartphone connectivity that provides quantitative hormone measurements and ovulation/fertile window prediction at home, helping women conceive and track cycles. Mira also enables research and detailed diagnostics on hormonal fluctuations, providing easy access to high resolution laboratory-grade measurements that are hard to obtain with traditional methods. Mira opens more opportunities for telemedicine, reduces hormone test overload, and helps physicians build a precise plan of care for each patient by giving them a tool that tracks full cycles and enables data collection throughout the treatment timeline. Digital health tracking solutions may provide incredibly efficient mechanisms for running the day-to-day of practices and improve their outcomes.                                        Features of the Mira  Fertility Tracking System                          The monitoring system includes test wands to sample urine at home and a reusable, palm-sized analyzer that quantitatively tracks fertility hormone levels such as Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Estradiol Metabolite (E3G), Pregnanediol-3-Glucuronide (PdG), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) syncs data to the Mira App. With greater than 99% accuracy in detecting the LH-surge (a primary indicator of ovulation) and the fertile window, patients have confidence in finding their peak fertile window and maximizing their chances of conception.                 The Mira App analyzes and displays actual hormone data and uses AI-powered algorithms to provide personalized and precise and fertile window prediction. The Mira Analyzer automatically syncs hormone test results to the Mira App using Bluetooth® technology. Personalized in-app testing reminders are sent based on individual cycles and fertility data. Users can also enter a full suite of additional fertility tracking data, including intercourse dates, cervical mucus, cervical anatomy, basal body temperature, and period data. The Mira App enables easy comparison of fertility and cycle data across multiple cycles, which can be used with healthcare professionals in patient health management.         Mira’s Accuracy is Proven  The Mira Analyzer was found to be equivalent in performance to the leading laboratory-grade reader through analytical performance testing.                                               In the figure, 160 Samples for LH testing and 104 samples for HCG testing were prepared. the samples were analyzed with Mira Analyzer and Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR (lab-grade analyzer) respectively by corresponding kit or reagent. The accuracy of the Mira analyzer and the correlation with Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR were calculated.                          Comprehensive women’s health tracking at home  Mira is FDA-listed for the at-home fertility tests that measure actual Estradiol Metabolite (E3G), Pregnanediol-3-Glucuronide (PdG), and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels. Together with the existing LH test, these wands will provide even more accurate knowledge into a woman’s fertility level and cycle, and discover deep insights into the fertile window and ovulation confirmation. Doctors are bringing Mira into natural family planning studies.                                        2018                                                              Luteinizing Hormone                              Ovulation usually happens 24 to 36 hours after the LH surge. Tracking LH allows patients to time intercourse to take adventage of this high fertility period and gives them the best chance at getting pregnant.                                        2020                                                              E3G                              E3G tracking allows detection of the full fertile window, including the days before an LH surge.                                        2021                                                              PdG                              Identifying your PdG levels can help you confirm ovulation and track your cycle.                                        2022                                                              FSH                              The test results of FSH test can be used as an aid in predicting menopause and as an adjunctive screen for fertility.                                         2023                                                              hCG                              Mira’s hCG test is designed to detect pregnancy as early as 4 days before the user’s expected period or 5 days before the day they missed their period.         How Mira is different  from other methods  Regular Ovulation Prediction Kits (OPKs) detect ovulation based on a fixed cut-off LH value, which may not be appropriate because every woman and every cycle can be different. Ultimately, in such cases OPKs can both lead to detection of false peaks, and to missed ovulation peaks.

Medical advisor and partner at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG    “The Mira Fertility Tracker offers excellent quality and accurate results at the patient's fingertips. As a health provider, I find that Mira’s quantitative measures far outweigh most qualitative over-the-counter kits. Mira is far more useful in clinical applications. We utilize Mira with our patients to help them successfully monitor, track and succeed in achieving pregnancies.”             Erin Foran Wolff, MD Partner at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG.    “As a fertility specialist, I was used to seeing my patients’ hormone results only twice per cycle. With Mira, I can see hormone patterns throughout many days of the cycle, over multiple months. This has provided clinical insight I have never had access to before, and allows me to tailor treatments in a much more individualized way. This personalized approach has helped patients become pregnant at significantly higher rates than standard, traditional, and generic fertility protocols.”             Gary S. Nakhuda, MD Research collaborator at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG.    ""From my perspective as a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, Mira is a game-changing tool for patients and clinicians. With the convenience of home urine testing, the quantitative data of a laboratory blood test, and an informative and engaging app for hormone tracking—it seems to be the best of all worlds to improve the patient experience and optimize treatment outcomes. We are actively pursuing approaches to incorporate Mira into fertility treatments to reduce the burden of unnecessary blood tests and clinic visits.”             Dr. Li-Shei Lin Certified in Ob/Gyn and reproductive endocrinology and infertility and clinical professor of reproductive medicine    “As female hormonal levels change according to the menstrual cycle, the knowledge of hormonal event such ovulation renders women the confidence and freedom in decision making when a reliable home test device is available.”             Dr. Marc Sklar The Fertility Expert    “My favorite way to track ovulation right now is Mira Fertility. It is high lab-grade quality hormone testing at home. My favorite thing about this technology, the App, and the whole system is that it really takes the guesswork out of ovulation tracking.”               We Work With The Leaders  Are you interested in partnership or research?

Is Mira right for your audience?              If your audience is interested in wellness, fitness, nutrition, sex, family planning and parenting, or any topics related to women’s health, Mira is a great match. Menstrual cycles play a key role in physical condition, mood and body functioning. There are a limited number of days per cycle when a woman can conceive. Tracking your fertility hormones and knowing exactly when these fertile days occur is essential to get pregnant or avoid pregnancy. Designed with irregular cycles in mind, Mira analyzes quantitative hormone levels to give you accurate insights on a fertile window for ones with variable cycles or PCOS.          Why Mira?  Mira is the first women’s health company that is able to provide this easy-to-use solution, giving women a comprehensive picture of their cycle and health. Through a clinical trial conducted with multiple hospitals, the Mira Analyzer was found to be equivalent in performance to leading laboratory grade readers. The Mira Fertility tracker uses AI to learn female’s changing hormone patterns. This put together in a highly personalized and accurate ovulation prediction, gives Mira’s customers specific fertility advice. Mira is FDA approved and FSA/HAS qualified. Financing for buying a Mira Starter Kit is also available.      What Makes Mira Different       No More Missed Peaks  The Mira method of analyzing fertility hormones gives you specific fertility hormone concentration levels, rather than the traditional ‘smiley face’ approach. Mira is different from all other OPK’s because Mira gives actual hormone concentrations with 99% accuracy.         More Fertile Days  Basal body temperature (BBT) increases after ovulation. In contrast, Mira’s lab-graded technology gives actual hormone concentrations and detects the entire fertile window up to 5 days before ovulation! Moreover, BBTchanges due to environmental and lifestyle factors. Mira learns your cycle, providing personalized ovulation detection for variable cycles.

The Information provided on the Company Websites is for information purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always seek such advice before the personal use of the Goods or in the case of concerns regarding the use of the Goods. Quanovate Tech Inc is not responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any form of damages whatsoever resulting from the use, misuse, or reliance on information contained in or implied by the information on its websites or information obtained from Goods.  The Buyer understands that the Mira Application and user instructions are currently available in English. Therefore, users must understand the English language well to use the product.  The Buyer understands that the testing data (‘Results’) stored in the Mira Application are uploaded in an encrypted format and stored in a secure database. The Buyer understands that the Results will be held separately from the billing and shipping address and any payment details, but for identification may contain user information such as email address, Analyzer serial number, and subscription code. The Company will store the Results in a de-identified or anonymous format indefinitely but reserves the right to archive data in the future for Buyers that have been inactive for more than (10) ten years. The Buyer agrees that the Company can use the Results for scientific research or product development but that they will remain anonymous in any materials shared outside of the Company.  From time to time, the Company will send out customer and research surveys which shall be answered by the Buyer voluntarily. The Company will inform the Buyer appropriately when the survey forms part of an approved clinical study. The Buyer understands that we will hold the Answers from these surveys separately from the billing and shipping address and any payment details, but for identification may contain user information such as email address, Analyzer serial number, and subscription code. The Company will store the Answers indefinitely but reserves the right to archive data in the future for Buyers that have been inactive for more than (10) ten years. The Buyer agrees that the Company can use the Answers from these surveys for scientific research or product development but that they will remain anonymous in any materials shared outside of the Company.  The Mira Application has functionality allowing the Buyer to share their charts and message information (‘Shared Information’) with other parties (‘Viewers’) by sending this information from the Mira Application. The Buyer understands that sharing this information is entirely at the Buyer’s discretion, and the Company shall bear no responsibility for such Shared details; however, it is interpreted or used by the Viewers. The Buyer understands that by sending an invitation to a Viewer, the Viewer shall also become bound by these Terms and Conditions upon acceptance of the invitation.  The Company and its authorized distributors acting on its behalf reserve the right to alter product specifications at any time after initial delivery without prior notice to the Buyer. The Company will offer an alternative product with the same or enhanced functionality where practicable.  The images of the Application interference shown on the website may include features and designs of a future release and may not reflect those of the current Application version.  Each service user (a “user”) uses the products and services at the user’s sole risk. This means that:    A user may get pregnant when using the products and services even if the user’s purpose for using the products and services is for natural family planning.  No guarantee using the products and services will assist a user in getting pregnant.  The user may or may not successfully discover a pattern that leads to a diagnosis of potential illness or disease using the products and services.  All Information is input by the user, who is solely responsible for interpreting their information.  Certain information provided through the service may involve discussion of reproductive anatomy and/or sexual acts and may not be appropriate for all users. If you are offended by material of sexual nature, including information about conceiving or family planning or discussion of reproductive anatomy, then you should not use the Products and Services,  SPECIAL CONDITIONS Individuals who have PCOS may experience unreliable results from Mira products. While these products may still help users assess their hormone levels—they may prove less effective in promoting successful conception for those with PCOS. If you have PCOS and are experiencing regular monthly periods, the Mira products may work as intended. Many women with PCOS use Mira to track their cycles and achieve healthy conception and pregnancy. However, if you have PCOS and are not having regular monthly periods, you may experience unreliable results. Furthermore, it may be difficult to define proper testing times or the stage of your cycle—though results may improve by testing daily. Please consult your doctor about how you can use Mira products to benefit from their use based on your condition. If you receive positive results continually, this may be a sign of abnormally elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. In such cases, the Mira products may be unreliable. Additionally, the Mira products are not intended for use in detecting PCOS. If you are uncertain about having PCOS, please consult with your doctor.  ORDERS   All orders shall be confirmed in ‘writing’ either by direct action on the company websites or by a confirmation email.  No quotation shall be binding on the Company until the price is paid in full by the Buyer and the order is confirmed in writing by the Company.  The company manages the payment process through Shopify, PayPal, Shop Pay, Google Pay, and Amazon Pay—which are well-known secure payment gateways. Therefore, the Buyer can be assured that they are safe to use.  The Buyer shall retain ownership of all results and the ability to view past data in the Mira Application. It is the Buyer’s responsibility to maintain the current version of the Mira Application and, in the case of changing mobile devices, to load the data onto the new device by downloading the current version of the Mira Application and logging in with prior user details.  The Buyer understands that the Mira Fertility product is a regulated medical device, and the Mira Analyzer and Mira Test Wands are non-returnable and non-refundable. For damaged or defective products covered by our one-year limited warranty described below, please contact us at support@miracare.com.  RETURN POLICY The Company can issue a full refund if the Buyer requests a refund before the package ships. However, since most Mira products are time sensitive, the orders are typically processed quickly. Orders placed before 12AM (PST time) daily are processed and shipped out the following day. Therefore, a fast turnaround occurs between placing the order and preparing the fulfillment. The Buyer should reach out ASAP if they would like to cancel their order. If the Buyer wants to return the product after it is shipped, the Buyer must keep it unopened, unused, and original. Unopened means the seals on the product box much be intact. And the Buyer should store the product in a dry environment between 4 ° to 30 °C (39 ° to 86 °F) and keep it away from direct sunlight. The Buyer must contact the Mira Support team within 20 days after the product is delivered. Shipping and handling charges from the original order, including VAT or other customs fees, are non-refundable. If the Buyer requests a paid return label, the Company will deduct 15% of the product’s original price (available for the US only). For non-US orders, the Buyer is responsible for shipping back the product. Please Note: The Company cannot accept product returns based on the following:  If it has been 20 days past the product’s delivery. If the seal is broken. If the product has been used or tampered with. If the product does not appear to be in its original condition.  The Buyer may cancel their subscription at any time. Please read this article carefully for more information on managing subscriptions. If the Buyer wants the Company to cancel the subscription, the Buyer must send the Company an explicit request at least 48 hours before the next order process date. Please Note: Snoozing the subscription or changing the next order date will not cancel the subscription. WARRANTY The Mira Analyzer is covered by a one-year limited warranty. This limited warranty applies for one (1) year from the date of purchase found on your receipt. Mira requires your original receipt to determine the warranty period. During the warranty period, Mira will either repair or replace (at its discretion) any defective Analyzer at no charge to you. Please note: Our technical team will determine if the Analyzer is defective. PRICES   The price payable for Goods shall be as displayed on the Company Websites or otherwise agreed in writing at the time of purchase.  In the US, all prices for the Mira Fertility product exclude Value Added Tax or other sales tax and carriage, which will be added to the invoice charge at the appropriate rate.  The Company reserves the right to adjust prices.  TERMS OF PAYMENT Unless otherwise stated by the Company in writing and recorded on the Company’s acknowledgment of the order, payment shall be made in advance for all Goods. DELIVERY   All times or dates for delivery of the goods are given in good faith. Time of delivery should not be of the essence of any Contract, nor shall the Company be under any liability for any delay beyond the Company’s control.  Delivery of the Goods shall be limited to Buyers over the age of 18, legally able to enter into the Contract, resident in, and (where applicable) accessing the Mira Website or Application.  All claims for loss due to damage in transit or non-delivery must be notified in writing by the Buyer to the Company: (a) within seven days of the actual delivery date for damage or (b) within ten days of the date of the invoice for non-delivery.  In the event of a valid claim for loss due to damage, non-delivery, or non-compliance with the Contract, the Company shall choose to either repair or replace the Goods at its expense. However, it shall not be under any further liability.  If the Buyer fails to give notice per the condition above, the Goods shall be deemed in all respects in accordance with the Contract.  ORDERING & CONTRACTS COMPANY WEBSITE   Some Goods can be ordered using the ‘Cart’ mechanism on the Company Website. The following steps form the Contract:   The Buyer fills the ‘Cart’ with the required items and continues to the appropriate payment screen.  The Buyer then enters payment details on the payment screen.  The Buyer is sent an order acknowledgment via email. Once payment has been received and the order accepted, the Goods will be dispatched, at which point the Contract shall be deemed in place.    Acceptance of Orders. At our sole discretion, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason at our sole discretion. You will be charged at the time you place your order, not when your order is shipped. Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limited quantities available, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or needs modification. If your order is canceled or modified after your credit card (or other payment accounts) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment accounts) in the amount of the charge or modification.  Referral Rewards. At our sole discretion, we reserve the right to alter, discontinue, refuse, or cancel referral rewards accrued under the referrals offered as presented with the Mira Analyzer, Mira wands, or Mira Application pre-order campaign. This also includes any other campaigns related to Mira products and services. You must already have a Mira account or set up a new one to redeem accrued referral rewards. We may need to contact you to manage and deliver your order and ensure the deliverability of your accrued referral rewards. You understand that we must have your active and valid email address and/or mailing address to deliver your accrued rewards. Rewards will accrue and be redeemable as defined by Mira.  Quantity Limits, Wholesale and Dealer Sales. Mira reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to limit the number of items purchased per person, household, or order. These restrictions may apply to orders placed by the same account or credit card and orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. We will provide a notification to the customer should such limits be applied. Specific orders constitute improper use of Mira and its products and services. At our sole discretion, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason at our sole discretion. At our sole discretion, Mira reserves the right to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, reselling shall be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any product(s) from Mira to commercialize that same product(s) with a third party.  You can purchase products and/or services on the website. We provide a link to a third-party vendor on our website, which will process your payment for products and services. When you click submit your order, your payment information will be handled by an independent third-party service, which operates under separate Terms and Conditions concerning your online payment transaction. Product and service refund requests will be decided and issued at the sole discretion of Mira.  PASSING OF TITLE AND RISK   The Goods shall remain the Company’s property until all payments under the Contract have been made in full and unconditionally. Once all payments are made, and from the delivery time, the Goods shall become the Buyer’s property.  In the event of failure to pay the price in accordance with the Contract, the Company shall have the power to resell the Goods.  CONDITIONS & WARRANTIES   The Contract shall not constitute a sale by description or sample.  Any conditions or warranties (whether express or implied by statute common law or arising from conduct or a previous course of dealing or trade custom or usage) as to the quality of the Goods, their fitness for any particular purpose, or correspondence with any description or sample are hereby expressly negatived.  DEFECTIVE GOODS   In respect of Goods supplied by the Company under a Contract, the Company undertakes that if within twelve months of delivery, a defect occurs under proper use (except for wear and tear), it will, at its discretion, repair or replace them. The Buyer shall inform the Company within seven days of such a defect occurring.  Nothing herein shall impose any liability on the Company in respect of any defect in the Goods arising out of the acts, omissions, negligence, or default of the Buyer, including any failure by the Buyer to comply with any recommendations of the Company as to storage and use of the Goods.

Understand your hormone results for confident decision-making now and in the future.           Why I started Mira Today Mira in the Future       Why I started The story behind Mira          As a young scientist, I was surrounded by very determined women, much like myself. Most of us were focused on our careers, so we decided to start our families later in life. But once we got to this stage, we were met with stigma and lack of information about our bodies—creating a lot of anxiety. Sooner rather than later, I noticed a big gap between trying to conceive tools available on the market and the real needs of people trying to reach our parenting goals. With 80% of people with hormone imbalances and up to 30% of couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility—it just didn’t add up. Through scientific research and speaking to my friends about their experiences, I quickly discovered OPKs weren’t helping either, especially if someone had to go through IVF/IUI. These methods only add guesswork and uncertainty—even though they promised otherwise. I created Mira because people's fertility journeys deserve accuracy and peace of mind. Mira offers lab-grade precision, is non-invasive, personalizes your results, and helps you save tons on out-of-pocket costs for fertility treatments.        “We deserve to make confident decisions with personalized & accurate results. Just like I did, when I used Mira to conceive after 35” Sylvia M. Kang. CEO at Mira  How Mira Works             Changing the narrative around reproductive health   There has always been a lack of research on reproductive health—which means no data and no personalization. We believe it doesn’t have to be this way. At Mira, we’re slowly changing how patients and professionals perceive reproductive health by allowing people to feel ownership over their health.            Owning your data means confident decisions  Our body, your rules—right? Right. But, patients often feel drowned in anxiety about their health due to a lack of education or misinformation. Mira translates your hormone data into personalized numbers, so decision-making won’t feel like taking steps in the dark. Replace guesswork for clarity, accuracy, and control.             Mira today The at-home mini lab        Technology designed for every journey   The Mira Analyzer uses immunochromatography with fluorescence labeling—the same technology labs use. The biggest difference? Our results are 100% personalized for your journey. Regain control and use Mira for fertility treatments, doctor’s appointments, future family planning, perimenopause symptoms, and get more support if you have PCOS or hormone imbalances.         Read what the media says about                                         More Articles       Mira in the future Together, we're making leaps           There’s a lot more to come We have big plans. Mira’s testing capabilities will continue to expand and include more than sex hormones. Soon, users will be able to track their general health, such as stress cortisol, testosterone, ketones, and more, with the Mira Analyzer.              Closing the research gap It seems like there’s “a lot we don’t know” when it comes to reproductive health for women and people with ovaries. We’re here to change that. We are using Mira for research and teaming up with renowned fertility experts, OBGYNs, and scientists to source data that matters—yours                                         Our Studies                                                   360-degree at-home health services We believe everyone should be able to access their health data from home. Health care professionals who use Mira can also improve fertility treatment progress (IVF) by reducing costs, minimizing blood draws, and improving outcomes by remotely tracking patients’ data. In turn, this ensures less stress and more success         See how we plan on expanding:      Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) monitoring       Early pregnancy tracking       Hormone health courses & community       Premium supplements & treatments       Stress hormones monitoring       Endocrine system monitoring       Telemedicine services     Get Started       Advisors               Dr. Li-Shei Lin Medical Advisor at Mira MD A board-certified reproductive endocrinologist, infertility specialist, a clinical faculty in a university.

And so, not long ago, we decided to use the power of science to positively impact the health and lifestyle of our friends and customers.

Key Findings: The concentration of E2 (estradiol) in serum and the concentration of urinary E3G (estrone-3-glucuronide) are good indicators of how many matured oocytes (egg development stage before fertilization) may be retrieved from the ovaries on the day of the trigger injection.                                 The results mean that monitoring levels of E3G in urine may predict how many eggs will be ready after retrieval from the ovaries to be fertilized or cryopreserved for fertilization in the future.                                 Also, urinary E3G has a slightly higher correlation to how many matured oocytes can be retrieved from the ovaries after trigger injection compared to serum estradiol. Learn More      ePosters Urinary E3G monitoring using the mira fertility tracker during COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) as an alternative to serum E2    Key Findings: The uE3G dynamics were comparable to serum E2 with a Spearman correlation of 0.82. Thus, at-home urine monitoring of uE3G is a viable alternative to serum E2 measurements during COH that is potentially more patient-friendly and convenient. Learn More      Open Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology A New Protocol for Controlled Ovarian Stimulation Monitoring by Self-Determination of Estrone-3-Glucuronide and Single Ultrasound (COSSESU)   Key Findings: By analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, it shows that on the basis of new diagnostic tests such as E3G in urine and telemedicine, patients are able to independently and actively participate in the treatment process. This new approach to COS monitoring can be successfully implemented in different protocols for ovarian stimulation. Learn More      Human Reproduction Urine estrone–3-glucuronide (E3G) assay: is there any place during ovarian stimulation for IVF cycles?   Key Findings: Serum E2 values were assessed routinely, while E3G values were measured and validated using a fluorescent immunoassay Mira Fertility Plus® analyzer. The urine E3G of the assay was validated for intra and inter-assay variability with a coefficient of variation of  Learn More       Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics Quantitative Versus Qualitative Estrogen and Luteinizing Hormone Testing for Personal Fertility Monitoring   Key Findings: The study established that due to the quantitative measurement of LH the peaks that indicates the most fertile period of the menstrual cycle by Mira monitor throughout 3 menstrual cycles, only 2% of LH peaks have been missed in comparison to 5% of peaks missed when using qualitative measurement with ClearBlue Fertility Monitor. Learn More       Fertility and Sterility Intelligent algorithm combined with a device that detects luteinizing hormone levels can improve the prediction accuracy of ovulation day   Key Findings: By analyzing the test data of Mira users and compared to the traditional calendar method, it shows that Mira can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of ovulation day compared with the calendar method. The more cycles a woman tests her LH hormone with this method, the higher accuracy the ovulation day prediction is. The average rate of ovulation prediction accuracy of the users’ first cycles using the calendar method is 29%. In the experiment group, the average rate of ovulation prediction accuracy of the users’ every later cycle gradually rises. The accuracy rate is 35% for cycle 2, 58% for cycle 3, and 77% for cycle 4.

Mira’s AI is state-of-the-art   Trained and optimized on 4M+ hormone data points, Mira’s smart technology gets smarter every day. Our AI learns about your cycle patterns and evaluates results without needing a fixed threshold.   See How Mira Works         Our users are loving Mira                 ​​​​Mira has been the easiest of my three testing methods (E3g and LH measured) because it automatically times and reads the sample, and is more hygienic. Mira ensures greater accuracy than the pee-on-a-stick method since you don’t need “line-eyes” or to take a range in uncertainty with visual biases. Review by S.B.              By far the best tracker I’ve ever used. I feel like the device is so much easier to understand than Clearblue and also being able to see the readings is amazing!!

OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG   “The Mira Fertility Tracker offers excellent quality and accurate results at the patient's fingertips. As a health provider, I find that Mira’s quantitative measures far outweigh most qualitative over-the-counter kits. Mira is far more useful in clinical applications. We utilize Mira with our patients to help them successfully monitor, track and succeed in achieving pregnancies.”            Erin Foran Wolff, MD Partner at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG.   “As a fertility specialist, I was used to seeing my patients’ hormone results only twice per cycle. With Mira, I can see hormone patterns throughout many days of the cycle, over multiple months. This has provided clinical insight I have never had access to before, and allows me to tailor treatments in a much more individualized way. This personalized approach has helped patients become pregnant at significantly higher rates than standard, traditional, and generic fertility protocols.”            Gary S. Nakhuda, MD Research collaborator at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG.   ""From my perspective as a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, Mira is a game-changing tool for patients and clinicians. With the convenience of home urine testing, the quantitative data of a laboratory blood test, and an informative and engaging app for hormone tracking—it seems to be the best of all worlds to improve the patient experience and optimize treatment outcomes. We are actively pursuing approaches to incorporate Mira into fertility treatments to reduce the burden of unnecessary blood tests and clinic visits.”            Dr. Li-Shei Lin Medical Advisor at Mira. Certified in Ob/Gyn and reproductive endocrinology and infertility and clinical professor of reproductive medicine   “As female hormonal levels change according to the menstrual cycle, the knowledge of hormonal event such ovulation renders women the confidence and freedom in decision making when a reliable home test device is available.”            Dr. Marc Sklar Partner at Mira. The Fertility Expert.   “My favorite way to track ovulation right now is Mira Fertility. It is high lab-grade quality hormone testing at home. My favorite thing about this technology, the App, and the whole system is that it really takes the guesswork out of ovulation tracking.”              Success Stories                                                                             Because of Mira, I Am Expecting My Second Miracle Rainbow Boy                                                         Thanks to Mira Fertility, Kristie found out that she was ovulating almost immediately after her period Kristie                                                                          Mira’s Precise and Easy to Use System Helped Me to Get My Son                                                         Mira was able to provide Nicole with information and answers that other fertility kits and even doctors could not.

If you are trying to conceive and would like to track the full fertile window, we recommend Mira Plus Starter Kit (Includes 10 E3G+LH Wands) or Mira Plus Starter Kit Super Bundle (Includes 30 E3G+LH Wands). If you would like to confirm whether the ovulation occurred and know the non-fertile window, we recommend Mira Plus Starter Kit + Confirm Bundle (Includes 10 E3G+LH Wands and 10 PdG Wands).        Can we use a single Mira Analyzer together with my partner?       Yes, you can! Two people can use the analyzer using different Mira App accounts. To do this, each person should connect the app to the analyzer and test. After the data syncs, disconnect the app from the analyzer to let the other person use it.        How do I know which wands I need?       If you’d like to predict your ovulation and 6-day fertile window, we suggest purchasing the Plus Wands (to measure the luteinizing hormone and estrogen). If you’d like to predict and confirm ovulation, we suggest purchasing the Plus Wands and the Confirm Wands (to measure PdG).        If our/my surrogate uses Mira, can I get access to their charts?       Yes, users can share their data via our app’s ""Partner mode.""

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor. 6 years ago, Octavia and her wife tried to have a baby and spent over $20,000, did 4 IUI’s, used several donors, had fertility treatments, and spent 16 months, never getting pregnant. Today 40-year-old Octavia is 8 weeks pregnant. Read on to learn more about Octavia’s trying to conceive story and how she got pregnant.  I have PCOS, struggled with irregular cycles, and was still 60 pounds overweight. My fertility doctor suggested I get healthier and lose 40 more pounds. I finally decided it was time to live healthier. It took me 3 years to lose 40 pounds of the weight and 3 more years to learn how to keep it off. I went back to college during this time, learned how to heal my trauma, and also added Quantum Human Design into my life that has allowed me to get past my trauma and heal my soul. Plus, live my life the way I was meant to live. After that healing, I haven’t had a problem w/ my maintaining my weight and my cycles have been normal for 2 years.      In January I turned 40 and my wife and I decided to try once more. We used a Mira fertility tracker, a live donor, a mensural cup, and at-home insemination. Month 4, we got pregnant. I swear I didn’t think it was real. I took 14 pregnancy tests and still didn’t believe it. We found out and got our BFP 10 days past ovulation and it has been the longest 5 weeks ever waiting to make it into my OBGYN to see if this baby was real! Today, I’m 8 weeks and my 8-week scan was perfect, perfect length, 180 bpm heart rate, and my ovaries and uterus are perfect. At 40 and 185 lbs, I’m not a high-risk pregnancy, the baby is perfect and I just wanted to share with you all to never lose faith and never give up hope. With PCOS since I was 21, irregular cycles since I was 19, never been pregnant, being overweight my whole life, being a lesbian, and being over 40, I thought there was no hope. I didn’t even believe this was a healthy pregnancy, but I was wrong. Taking care of myself, getting healthy, healing my trauma, heart and soul allowed me to experience this beautiful miracle.  Please take care of the body that will house your baby, get healthy and heal from your childhood! Your future baby and you deserve it. It’s possible. Don’t give up!

As a result, there’s a lack of education and access to personalized information, a shortage of helpful tools on the market to manage symptoms, and almost no recognition of how menopause affects people in the workplace. We asked 1000 people about how menopause impacts their life and career experience, and the results speak for themselves.      A stage in life that affects us all      1.2 billion people will be menopausal or postmenopausal by 2030. And 47 million enter the category every year.      Menopause isn’t just a “women’s issue.” When someone experiences menopause, their surroundings are also affected —including personal and work life. This is why everyone should be educated about what happens during this stage in someone’s life. If we think about it, we’ve all met someone who is going through menopause — whether it’s a relative, spouse, colleague, or friend.            Menopause isn’t scary. The lack of information is.     Because menopause remains taboo, there’s a sense of embarrassment and discomfort when discussing it openly. This aggravates the lack of knowledge and inhibits people from seeking help — making it hard to pinpoint symptoms, find treatment, and get mental health support.        Don’t know the 34 symptoms of menopause.    Only check their health when their health provider requests it.                  Time seems to be an important factor — so we took a closer look  Based on an average 100-year human life span, menopause and postmenopause take up a large percentage of someone’s life.         Menopause and postmenopause take up about 49% of people’s lives. 47% of people started having perimenopause/menopause symptoms from age 35 through 45          Trying to conceive, career, and menopause.      1 More and more people are delaying pregnancy and prioritizing their careers. The US's median age of giving birth has officially hit 30, meaning more people are trying to conceive closer to perimenopause. Source   2                              People experiencing menopause are the fastest-growing demographic in the US workforce. But 2 out of 5 are planning to retire earlier than originally planned. (Source: Mira Survey)   3 39.6% of women say that perimenopause/menopause symptoms have significantly affected their work life. (Source: Mira Survey)                     Reaching the top of the ladder   Reaching greatness in your career may come hand in hand with reaching menopause. Nowadays, many women enter leadership positions at approximately 45 to 55. Simultaneously, menopause symptoms such as insomnia, depression, cognitive impairment, and depression, to name a few, are setting in. For many reasons, individuals in this position are afraid to speak up about their situation — stigma being predominant. This means little awareness, knowledge, and almost no care procedures in the workplace.          Here’s what we found: Menopause and the workplace:          Top symptoms people experience:                  How menopause symptoms affect people’s work lives:      “Brain fog and difficulty concentrating affected my ability to make decisions in an appropriate amount of time. I worried I would make mistakes, which increased my anxiety. I retired early due to menopause and Covid.”     “I can't sit for too long, or my joints get stiff and painful, but I sit at my desk to do my work.”     “Unable to concentrate on my tasks, fatigue makes it difficult to get through my day. Anxiety and irritability make it difficult to deal with people.”              #SayMenopause  Positive change happens when we start talking about the things we need to change. These wonderful women have shared their stories with us, and you can too.                Rashelle “It's easy to put ourselves on the back burner, but health should always be our #1 priority.”           Jodie “Women who are having perimenopausal or menopausal symptoms don't know who to talk to. Let's change that.”              Studies link FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) levels to perimenopause and menopause Did you know? If your FSH rises and your estrogen declines, this may indicate your transition into menopause. And according to this study, estradiol levels begin to fall, and FSH levels rise two years before your last period.                    Menopause is the start of a remarkable chapter   We believe that actively learning about perimenopause and menopause gives people confidence about how to best approach this next chapter in their lives.

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor. 31-year-old Jennifer and her partner had been trying for 10 months to get pregnant. But to say that her trying to conceive journey was filled with challenges is an understatement. Read on to learn more about the difficulties that the couple faced as well as how a supportive environment, along with Mira, aided the couple on their trying to conceive journey.  Discovering Mira Jennifer and her partner were discussing about trying to get pregnant when they learned about ovulation and how tracking ovulation would be helpful on their trying to conceive journey. Jennifer immediately started looking for suitable products and chanced upon Mira’s website on her search. The positive reviews and stories that flowered Mira’s website convinced her and she placed her order without hesitation. Multiple losses When Jennifer received her Mira package, she followed the instructions religiously and used it regularly. Soon enough, after just a couple of months, the couple found out that they were pregnant in May 2020. The happiness and excitement, however, were short-lived because they ended up having a chemical pregnancy—a very early miscarriage that occurs when an egg is fertilized but doesn’t fully implant in the uterus—just a couple of weeks later. The couple tried to remain positive through their first miscarriage. In fact, they immediately started trying while at the same time tracking ovulation with Mira again. Almost immediately, the couple got pregnant on Jennifer’s next cycle. But once again, the couple was faced with bad news. This time, Jennifer made it to eight weeks and her first ultrasound. Unfortunately, she was diagnosed with a blighted ovum and a missed miscarriage. She even had to have surgery done two months later. Devastated, the couple took a few months off trying so that her cycle could get back to normal.  Seeking help and alternatives In addition to Mira’s products, Jennifer explored her options so that she could maximize her chances of getting pregnant again. She had heard about using ovulation test strips to help her track and detect when she was ovulating. She expected that the test strips would work alongside Mira’s products to tell her when she would most likely conceive so that her and her partner could try for a baby. Unfortunately, the traditional test kits provided inaccurate information that left her discouraged. Moreover, she felt that these kits were a pain to use. “I hated them. I actually ended up throwing a bunch away and giving some to a friend. They would always be incorrect and always give me an error message when using. I think I only used them for one cycle before just committing back to a Mira-only routine.” Along the way, Jennifer and her partner also saw a fertility coach because they were afraid that they were going to have to go through more miscarriages if they did not seek help. The couple wanted to discuss options with a doctor. The couple was one month in with working with their fertility coach when they got pregnant naturally! Mira’s simplicity and effectiveness Jennifer loved that Mira was easy to use and left no room for misinterpretation. Mira provided actual numbers and detailed information that were easy to understand. It even provided her with a lot of information about her health that she never knew existed. “It was so simple to use. Once I started tracking my ovulation and cycle and had my Mira app logged it just notified me when it got closer and when to test. I honestly don’t think I would have gotten pregnant without the help of Mira. I always try to prepare ahead of time so I can make sure I have enough wands available but that is the feature that I like the most because it takes the guess work out of everything. I just loved it and will 100% use it if we decide we are going to have another baby in the future.” Jennifer also loved that Mira is a brand that constantly innovates. With new products and updates, she is excited to be able to utilize all of the products simultaneously when trying to get pregnant in the future. The importance of support Throughout the couple’s entire trying to conceive journey, their family and friends were extremely supportive. Jennifer also found support in Mira’s support groups as well as other support groups on Facebook. She took comfort in knowing that there were other couples who had experienced the same types of losses and felt less alone. She also wanted to let others know of the importance of staying positive and calm. “When you are growing up imagining starting a family you never really know what goes into it. I never knew I had to track ovulation and that there were only certain times in a cycle you could get pregnant. I literally had no idea until we started doing research when my husband and I decided we were ready to try. There is a lot that goes into getting pregnant and having support around you is the best medicine.”  Thrilled to have found Mira on her pregnancy journey, Jennifer told everyone she knew about Mira, in hopes that she could provide them with the support that she received. “Like I have said numerous times—Mira is the best product on the market right now with assisting women to get pregnant naturally.

Please consult with your doctor.  “My journey to a healthy pregnancy has been a long and winding one, with many twists and turns. But Mira gave me the confidence to take the final step towards motherhood.   My story actually starts way back in 2009. I found out that I had PCOS so I tried using the basal body thermometer with a partner, to try and pinpoint ovulation. Then I put my desire to build a family on hold so that I could focus on changing careers and becoming a better version of myself. I wanted to be sure I was ready to be a parent.       Mira BBT thermometer Track your cycle naturally. Chart your results automatically. Buy now    IVF and heartbreak In 2020 I found out that I had endometriosis and one of my tubes was blocked. This was a blow as at this time I felt like I was ready to try to get pregnant. I had pelvic surgery – a laparoscopy –  then I healed. Once I was better I tried IUI – but unfortunately, it didn’t work.   I then saved up money for IVF, as my insurance didn’t cover it. I did IVF and a fresh transfer in July of 2021 but sadly miscarried in September. Then immediately following the miscarriage I became pregnant again in October 2021, naturally with my partner. This was a pleasant but very unexpected surprise. Then I miscarried in December of 2021.   Investigations after loss These losses were heartbreaking. I wanted to understand what could be happening. I had genetic testing on myself, HSG, recurrent pregnancy loss testing, fluid ultrasounds, laparoscopy, pelvic MRI, numerous ultrasounds, and bloodwork. All the investigations under the sun. Because of my age and low ovarian reserve, doctors recommended that I do the IVF with the PGD testing, where they test the embryos in the lab before transfer. The concern is that my embryos may be more likely to have chromosomal abnormalities because of my advanced maternal age.  I considered adoption but wanted more than anything to give birth to a child of my own. I am a teacher and have worked with children for most of my adult life. It is sad that I have spent every day working with children, yet struggled to have a family of my own.   The financial and emotional toll of infertility This process has been draining emotionally as well as financially. My state only offers assisted reproduction coverage to women who get pregnant with their husbands’ sperm. I am currently single, and unmarried so even if my company offered it, I wouldn’t qualify. Currently, the health insurance offered to public school teachers in my state does not offer assisted reproduction benefits at all, so I have had to save money to pay for the procedures out-of-pocket.       Need fertility guidance from a pro? Book online consultation with our fertility coach. Schedule Now    A glimmer of hope Then I found a network of naturopathic doctors and attended a conference about tech for women. I learned about ways to improve egg quality and hormonal balance. This was also around the time I saw an ad for Mira on Facebook. I started tracking with the Mira app to learn more about my body and my cycle and went back to tracking my Basal Body Temperature. I also re-did the HSG in July of 2023 and both tubes were clear, with no blockage! Things were looking up!  When I noticed a more normal 3-month pattern on the Mira App, I decided to strike while the iron was hot…in November of 2023, I tried again with IUI. I used Clomid for 5 days and a trigger shot to induce ovulation. The procedure worked. So far I am 9 weeks into a normal healthy pregnancy! Over all of these years, I came up with a plan on when to try and when to begin trying something else. Finally, I have my happy ending.   Advice to others For anyone else going through a tough fertility journey, I would tell them to join support groups in person or online, to work on stress management, and if they are religious to pray.

Please consult with your doctor.  “My partner and I have been together for 3 and a half years and decided to start trying for a baby last March. We had a trip to Vegas planned in January for my 30th, so we decided to start trying after that!   My first ovulation was in March and we sadly did not conceive. But we kept trying. April and May came and went and we still hadn’t conceived. Then in June, the news we had been waiting for – I was pregnant! We were over the moon but sadly our joy was short-lived. At a scan in August, we found out our pregnancy had ended in a missed miscarriage. There was no heartbeat.    Trying after loss After our pregnancy loss in August, we did not know what to do – it was a really tough time. We tried waiting for it to pass naturally, but I ended up going for a scan around 6 weeks later, only to be told there was still product left over from the miscarriage. I decided to have a D&C (a procedure to remove tissue from inside your uterus) at the end of September.  I didnʼt get my first period back until the end of October. At this point, we started using cheap Ovulation Predictor Kits to track my ovulation. They seemed to tell me I was ovulating on day 18 or 19, so we kept trying. That month was unsuccessful, and so were November and December. I remember thinking I was pregnant in December as I had spotting a few days after ovulation and got excited thinking it was ovulation bleeding. It was another disappointment.   Enter Mira That’s when we decided to give Mira a try. My partner could see how much I wanted to be pregnant and how it not happening was affecting my mood and general happiness, so when he saw an ad for Mira he decided to purchase it straight away! Not only did I hope it would help us conceive but I also just wanted to get to know my hormonal health after so much heartbreak.    In the first cycle we tried Mira, ovulation was confirmed on cycle day 23. 12 days later – I had a positive pregnancy test! We couldn’t believe it! We expected Mira to make it easier to confirm ovulation and ensure my hormones were okay but we never expected to become pregnant the first time trying, but are so glad we did!   Advice for others I definitely recommend Mira to anyone trying to conceive. Of course, I believe a part of it was luck, but Mira definitely gave us peace of mind in seeing my other hormones rise and confirm ovulation. There are other options out there to help with TTC and fertility issues, but Mira is so convenient and easy to use. I definitely recommend it and have been so pleased with the results!”       Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now          Recent Stories After miscarriage      Trending Topics Irregular Cycles Relationship Meditation OPK Weight Gain Ebook Covid-19 Infections Fertility Nutrition Alternative solutions Stories LH Natural Fertility Planning Miscarriage hCG Male Fertility Trying to Avoid Natural Family Planning FSH Cramps & Pain fertility supplements Fertility Fertity AMH Mira Partnerships TSH Prolactin Fertility Coaching Hormone Coaching Mira App Tips Early Pregnancy Symptoms (DPO) BBT Postpartum Unexplained Infertility Discharge Quiz TWW Workouts Luteal Phase Mental Health Checklist Fertility Tea Lifestyle Ovulation Tracking Comparison Supplements Sex Pregnancy Test Period Planning for pregnancy Trying to Conceive LGBTQ Ovulation Cycles Tracking Progesterone Estrogen Pregnancy Hormones PCOS Early Access Bleeding & Spotting Endometriosis Fertility Treatments Inclusivity Hormone Imbalances Data Safety Complications Birth Control Research Women's Health Hormone Tracking Hormones Tracking Mira Fertility Monitor 35+ TTC Trouble Conceiving Symptoms Perimenopause Menopause   Free TTC Book                              Download “The Ultimate Guide To Fertility”                                                              Send me the eBook                                          Your fertility journey starts now Understand the full scope of your cycle, trends, and actual hormone concentrations.

Please consult with your doctor.  “Getting pregnant is supposed to be easy right?  That’s what my husband and I thought too, but after 8 years of unexplained infertility, trying to conceive was anything but easy.  I bought Mira out of desperation and expected it to be like all of the other countless fertility gadgets and gimmicks we had tried.  A small part of me still held out hope and I’m so glad I did.  Mira has been a game changer for us and after 8 years of trying, we are finally pregnant. This is my story of how I used Mira to help me learn more about my body and ultimately get pregnant.” My history “In my late teen years I was diagnosed with PCOS and have struggled with hormonal imbalance.  Obviously this can create a whole host of symptoms to deal with, but I never expected that trying to get pregnant would be one of them. Since getting married I have struggled with irregular cycles and never really knew when I ovulated.  It’s been a constant struggle and I never expected that learning about my body would be this hard.”      Trying to get pregnant “My husband and I always knew we wanted kids so we began trying right away after getting married.  Like a lot of people, we expected it to be easy. It’s what your body is meant to do so we thought it would just be a matter of time before our efforts would pay off.  We were expecting to be able to get pregnant and stay pregnant, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way.   Over the past 8 years, I have fallen pregnant 4 times. Each pregnancy has ended in miscarriage. I knew my body was capable of getting pregnant but a piece of the puzzle was still missing. After multiple lab tests and rounds of medical appointments, I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility on top of PCOS and hormonal imbalance. To stimulate ovulation, my doctor put me on Letrozole – a fertility treatment specifically designed for those with issues ovulating. It’s often the first step in fertility treatments, before undergoing more invasive (and expensive) treatments.”         Finding Mira “Over the years we have used multiple gadgets and gimmicks to try and get pregnant.  I’ve tried numerous different OPKs, all without much success. I saw an ad for Mira on Facebook and had seen reviews floating around on TikTok. This led me to read many more reviews and testimonials about how the device had worked for others.  In all honesty, I had been let down so many times that I didn’t have much hope this device would work.   Boy was I wrong!  With Mira I was able to track LH, E3G, PdG, and FSH and see my unique hormonal curve.  Mira has not only helped me get pregnant, but helped me understand my body better.      Hormones were always a mystery but now I can see how they work in relation to one another and what my personal hormone curve looks like.  I was able to pinpoint my ovulation even while being on medication to help stimulate ovulation.  It took 9 months of dedicated tracking and testing, but we were finally able to successfully conceive with Mira.”   Advice to others “Infertility of any kind is a difficult and stressful journey.  Don’t give up hope!  This is a road no one should have to walk alone.  Mira helped me feel proactive and supported throughout this journey.  Not only was I able to interact with others in the community and find support, but it also helped with my doctor’s appointments.  Doctors don’t always listen to their patients but with Mira I had the data to back it up.  I 100% recommend using Mira to anyone struggling or even those just wanting to learn more about their body.  Mira was the piece of the puzzle we needed!”      Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now          Recent Stories PCOS After miscarriage      Trending Topics Irregular Cycles Relationship Meditation OPK Weight Gain Ebook Covid-19 Infections Fertility Nutrition Alternative solutions Stories LH Natural Fertility Planning Miscarriage hCG Male Fertility Trying to Avoid Natural Family Planning FSH Cramps & Pain fertility supplements Fertility Fertity AMH Mira Partnerships TSH Prolactin Fertility Coaching Hormone Coaching Mira App Tips Early Pregnancy Symptoms (DPO) BBT Postpartum Unexplained Infertility Discharge Quiz TWW Workouts Luteal Phase Mental Health Checklist Fertility Tea Lifestyle Ovulation Tracking Comparison Supplements Sex Pregnancy Test Period Planning for pregnancy Trying to Conceive LGBTQ Ovulation Cycles Tracking Progesterone Estrogen Pregnancy Hormones PCOS Early Access Bleeding & Spotting Endometriosis Fertility Treatments Inclusivity Hormone Imbalances Data Safety Complications Birth Control Research Women's Health Hormone Tracking Hormones Tracking Mira Fertility Monitor 35+ TTC Trouble Conceiving Symptoms Perimenopause Menopause   Free TTC Book                              Download “The Ultimate Guide To Fertility”                                                              Send me the eBook                                          Your fertility journey starts now Understand the full scope of your cycle, trends, and actual hormone concentrations.

From confused to conception - how hormone monitoring helped Sebrina make sense of her cycle and get pregnant   Sebrina S.          This describes a Mira customer’s personal experience and/or was sourced from a review or interview. Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor.  “After more than three years of trying to get pregnant, I knew that I needed to try something different if I wanted to be successful. Miscarriages, long cycles, PCOS, and a host of other issues meant that trying to conceive was like playing whack-a-mole each month trying to stay on top of everything.  This is my story of how the Mira hormone monitoring device helped me make sense of everything and put me on the path to parenthood.” My history “My medical history is somewhat complicated and I knew that trying to conceive might be a challenge. I have hypothyroidism, which is easily managed by medication, but I also have fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition and can really wreak havoc on all parts of your life since it involves a lot of tiredness and pain in all areas of your body.  On top of all that, I also have PCOS, a hormone disorder that causes problems in the ovaries. Even though it’s one of the most common causes of female infertility, it’s also highly treatable so I wasn’t going to let it stop me from trying to conceive.    PCOS can be one heck of a ride for your health and can cause major issues with your period. I knew this from firsthand experience because I had extremely long cycles and I never knew when I ovulated.  Traditional ovulation tracker apps never really worked for me. They usually follow the calendar method and rely on average cycle lengths to predict ovulation. That may be fine for some people, but when you have PCOS your cycle lengths are anything but average. I was having super long cycles and never knew when I ovulated.  I knew I could get pregnant, because I had unfortunately suffered two miscarriages, but predicting ovulation was the key to getting pregnant and with my cycle variability it was a challenge.” Tracking ovulation “I know there are a lot of methods to track your period and try and predict ovulation, but having PCOS I found them cumbersome to use and could never see a pattern. And since you can’t get pregnant unless you’re ovulating (and taking advantage of your fertile window), figuring out when I ovulated was key.  I knew there had to be a better way and after 3 long years of trying, I looked for an alternative.”  My experience with Mira “Finding Mira and learning about the benefits of home hormone testing was a game changer.  Since hormones control everything (including ovulation), the ability to monitor my hormones with lab-grade tests finally made it possible to predict my ovulation.”      “Even with my long cycles and never knowing if or when I ovulated, using Mira helped me find my fertile window and see a pattern.  I was finally able to know when I was ovulating and could see the data right there in the app.  The device itself was easy to use and practically foolproof.  Not only that, but having the information on hand was extremely helpful and knowing that I could share it with my medical team was just an added bonus.   Getting pregnant isn’t for the faint of heart but when you have PCOS (among other issues), it can be downright frustrating. Mira took the guesswork out of it and allowed me to capture my cycle patterns and pinpoint ovulation. Not only did I learn more about my body, but tracking my key fertility hormones allowed me to see my complete fertile window, and plan accordingly.                         After three long years, trying to decipher my health and period, I firmly believe that using Mira is what helped me finally get pregnant. My health challenges meant traditional methods were nothing more than a shot in the dark with no ability to figure out what went wrong. With Mira I’m able to clearly see the data in the app and see patterns from the test results.” Advice for others “You may have one or many health challenges, but don’t let that hold you back. Knowledge is power and the more you can learn about your health and your cycle, the more you can use that knowledge to help you reach whatever fertility goals you have in mind.”       Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now          PCOS Irregular

Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor.   Bridgette felt like she had been written off by her doctors for getting pregnant again, but she still wanted to try again.  So she was looking for a device that would make life easier for her and help guide the process of trying for a second baby.  Read on to learn how Mira helped her take control of her reproductive options and how it helped her get pregnant. First time hearing the diagnosis   When Bridgette had her first baby, she was newlywed and had no issues getting pregnant.  Being diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome and Hashimoto’s disease, she had always been told that she would have difficulties getting pregnant at all.  Autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto’s can affect your fertility in a number of ways, but Bridgette was in her early 20’s when she was told this so pregnancy wasn’t even on her radar yet.  Like a lot of women, since she wasn’t interested in getting pregnant at that point in her life, she didn’t even consider that there could be issues down the road or what her future fertility might look like.  She wasn’t ready to have the conversations yet even though she’d been warned by every doctor about the difficulties she might face.  So when she got pregnant with her first without even trying, she had no idea what to expect when trying for a second baby. Knowing that she might need assistance in some way to get pregnant again, Bridgette searched for a device that would be easy for her to use and could help measure hormones.  One of the ways autoimmune diseases often affect fertility is through hormone production, so naturally, Bridgette was drawn to a device that could provide lab-quality hormone tracking at home.  She was looking for something that was easy to use and user-friendly.  Thankfully she was able to purchase the device with her husband’s health savings account and got started testing and tracking right away.   She suffered a chemical pregnancy her first month of using Mira, even with the use of Clomid to help ovulation.  Together with her reproductive endocrinologist, Bridgette kept on a course of Clomid and kept trying.  She was frustrated with the results and planned to try out IUI as a next step in trying to conceive.  But with a “hail mary” of 50mg of Clomid, Bridgette was willing to give it one more shot before looking at other options. Her mother had issues getting pregnant with her brother and had successfully used Clomid as well.  In those days, no one in her family really understood fertility issues, and she had nowhere to turn.  Her mother was diagnosed with endometriosis and thyroid issues, so Bridgette knew what to expect.  No one else in her family knew what to expect or had any issues with fertility, so she was really on her own in terms of how to navigate these waters.      With the help of Mira, she was able to know her timing and when her fertile window was to make the best of the Clomid dose.  Not only did she find her results easy to read, but Mira helped her figure out when her LH surge occurred so she could make a game plan.  Although her doctors weren’t necessarily interested in seeing the data, Mira allowed Bridgette to have some control over the situation and helped ease her fears of not being able to get pregnant. The waiting game At approximately 8 DPO, Bridgette was overcome with nausea and a feeling her body was just “off”.  She had taken a pregnancy test that morning but it had come out negative.  Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something felt different.  After a bout of nausea and a couple of other little things, she took another test that night and saw a very faint line that confirmed she was in fact pregnant.  Bridgette’s prayers were answered and after the “hail mary” of Clomid, she was now officially pregnant.   Finding support Although she didn’t join the group right away, the Mira Facebook Group was a big support for Bridgette.  Other members helped her interpret graphs and curves and she found it super helpful to read the charts and posts from other women going through the same thing.  Moderators and veteran users alike were a huge source of strength and moral support.   When you have no one in your life who really knows what you’re going through, it can become mentally draining to face months of not knowing.  Bridgette found she was constantly riding this roller coaster and beating herself up because she wasn’t pregnant yet.  Having an online source of support really gave her a sense of community.  Not everyone had a similar story, but they could all appreciate what she was going through and that support proved immeasurable. Advice for others Bridgette advises others not to give up.  As she said, “if this is truly what you want, go for it!”  There’s always a light at the end of the tunnel and even on your darkest days, you can find hope.  And never be sorry for standing up for yourself and advocating with doctors.  “Be your biggest advocate” is a common piece of advice but when it comes to fertility it can really help to stick up for yourself.  Feel all the feelings you need to feel, but don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and what you know you want.  You know your body better than anyone and it can pay to invest in yourself and what you’re going through.           Recent Stories After miscarriage      Trending Topics Irregular Cycles Relationship Meditation OPK Weight Gain Ebook Covid-19 Infections Fertility Nutrition Alternative solutions Stories LH Natural Fertility Planning Miscarriage hCG Male Fertility Trying to Avoid Natural Family Planning FSH Cramps & Pain fertility supplements Fertility Fertity AMH Mira Partnerships TSH Prolactin Fertility Coaching Hormone Coaching Mira App Tips Early Pregnancy Symptoms (DPO) BBT Postpartum Unexplained Infertility Discharge Quiz TWW Workouts Luteal Phase Mental Health Checklist Fertility Tea Lifestyle Ovulation Tracking Comparison Supplements Sex Pregnancy Test Period Planning for pregnancy Trying to Conceive LGBTQ Ovulation Cycles Tracking Progesterone Estrogen Pregnancy Hormones PCOS Early Access Bleeding & Spotting Endometriosis Fertility Treatments Inclusivity Hormone Imbalances Data Safety Complications Birth Control Research Women's Health Hormone Tracking Hormones Tracking Mira Fertility Monitor 35+ TTC Trouble Conceiving Symptoms Perimenopause Menopause   Free TTC Book                              Download “The Ultimate Guide To Fertility”                                                              Send me the eBook                                          Your fertility journey starts now Understand the full scope of your cycle, trends, and actual hormone concentrations.

This describes a Mira customer’s personal experience and/or was sourced from a review or interview. Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor. If you’ve ever googled “pregnant at” and your age then you’re not alone.  After having her first baby at 39 with no issues, Kerry didn’t expect any concerns when she wanted to start trying again.  But as the months went on, she found herself turning to Dr. Google more and more for any bit of information that could help her.    When she did fall pregnant, her joy was short-lived after a miscarriage at 9 weeks but thanks to genetic testing she knew the embryo was chromosomally healthy.  This gave her hope that her body knew what to do, but just needed a bit of help.  But as any woman knows, time is not always on your side, and being in her 40’s now meant she needed to figure things out right away.  After a barrage of tests to investigate, doctors found she had a partial uterine septum and Kerry underwent two different surgeries to correct the issue. Cleared to start trying again, Kerry got pregnant right away but unfortunately, another miscarriage ended her hopes again.  Knowing that her age could be an issue, she turned to a fertility clinic for more testing and blood work.  Doctors told her not to waste her time on IVF and gave Kerry and her partner a less than 1% chance of successfully getting pregnant.  Not exactly the best news when you’re up against the clock, but it wasn’t enough to deter them.   At this time, Kerry found her cycles started getting more irregular and her doctor advised she was entering perimenopause.  Fearing her hopes of another baby would be out of reach, she opted for IVF and was able to get 1 viable embryo.  Her first transfer was canceled because of ovulation timing and when it finally happened, the embryo didn’t take.  Cue another round of IVF with timed intercourse but her body was just not responding.   Bad news on top of more bad news dashed Kerry’s hopes of ever getting pregnant.  They’d been trying for more than 2 years and didn’t know what they could do to improve their chances.  At 43, Kerry felt like she was running out of time and that her biology was against her.  She had a partial uterine septum and fluid in her uterine lining as well as swollen Fallopian tubes.  In addition to these issues, she also had extremely low AMH levels.   AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) is an important indicator of female fertility and your AMH levels are a good indicator of ovarian reserve. If you are trying to conceive, this can be an important hormone to track especially as you age.  As a woman progresses through her most fertile years, levels of this hormone (along with your ovarian reserve) begin to drop.  Only healthy, functional follicles produce AMH so if your levels of this hormone are low, your ability to get pregnant may suffer.    AMH levels change over time and decline as you age and Kerry’s levels were painfully low.  Along with fertility issues, low AMH levels may also increase your risk of having a miscarriage once you are pregnant.  Unfortunately, Kerry knew this all too well since she had suffered from two miscarriages.  And after 5 failed IVF rounds, things weren’t looking good. Kerry was determined to figure this out but was at a loss as to what she could do to help things along.  More testing at the fertility clinic to figure out the timing was eventually put on hold when the world was put on hold by a global pandemic.  With everything shut down, Kerry again turned to google where she discovered Mira.  Being unable to continue with in-clinic appointments, she was desperate to do anything that could put her in the best position possible for a healthy pregnancy.  She was already well versed on fertility diets and supplements, but Mira was a game changer for predicting ovulation and tracking her cycle.   Before Mira, Kerry had gone the usual route of testing with OPK’s.  She found them hard to read and never got a clear result on any of the tests she used.  She never felt sure of when she was ovulating and using OPK’s didn’t provide her the clarity she needed.  With Mira, she was able to see numeric readings that confirmed ovulation and her fertile window.  She could see a clear pattern and be able to see the actual numbers was very comforting.  By this time, the fertility clinic was returning to in-person visits but shortly after her appointment she got the best news of all – she was pregnant again! After the difficulties, she experienced she felt like she was waiting to exhale but the pregnancy progressed without issue.  Opting for early testing to confirm the pregnancy and ultrasounds to check progress, Kerry couldn’t believe she was really pregnant.  Mira not only helped her track her hormones but also gave her peace of mind knowing she could look at the data.  She and her partner welcomed a healthy baby, and she credits it all to Mira.     Advice for others   Looking at statistics online can be good for guidance, but no one else is like you, and getting to know your own body can be a game changer.  Kerry found it extremely helpful to see the numbers and patterns.  She hopes that her story can give others the same hope she felt from reading about others’ success.  Trying to get pregnant at an advanced maternal age isn’t hopeless and even though the cards were stacked against her, she found a way.   Kerry suggests Mira to anyone who wants to track their cycle and keep an eye on their fertility, even if they’re not actively trying to get pregnant.  In fact, she plans to keep using the device just to see how the data changes as she enters perimenopause.  You can still get pregnant in perimenopause so it’s not off the table, but it helps to have the data to back you up.  And like Kerry said, it only needs to happen once!   The pictures provided are illustrations.

Boosts your reproductive health*                 Folate, Zinc, Selenium, and vitamins E and D support your reproductive health and boost your chances of             conception.                 Balances your hormones*                 Vitamins B, Magnesium, and Vitamin D help balance your hormones and promote healthy ovulation. They also             help make your cycles regular, thus increasing your chances of conception! Vitamin B6 helps increase             progesterone production and strengthens your uterine lining.                 Supports your immune system*                 Vitamins A, D, C, E, and Selenium strengthen your immune system. This protects you from infections and             promotes your well-being.                 Promotes healthy baby bones*    15 mcg of Vitamin D3, Vitamin K, Manganese, and Zinc help your future baby develop strong bones.      Supports your baby’s brain and spinal cord development*                 Folate, Iodine, and Choline support your pregnancy and the development of your future baby's nervous system,             including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. We've included Folate in the form of 5-MTHF, also known as             methylfolate—this is the preferred form for supplementation. This is because it represents the active form             of folate utilized by the body's tissues.                 Helps build blood cells*                 Folate and Vitamin B12 contribute to red blood cell formation and help carry oxygen to the future baby. Iron             is also essential to building up blood cells, while vitamin C and Copper help to promote iron absorption                 Relieves tension and calms the nervous system*    Magnesium and Vitamin B6 promote tension relief—which is essential for a healthy pregnancy.           *The Food and Drug Administration has not evaluated these statements.

Ideally, you'll want to begin as soon as you decide to conceive and at least 3 months before conception.                 Taking prenatal supplements during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is crucial to support your baby's                 development.                      How should I take the vitamins?     We recommend taking two (2) capsules per day.                     Can I take Mira Prenatal Multi-Vitamins without a prescription?                                  Yes, you can. However, we always recommend consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any                 multivitamins.

We've carefully formulated our supplements without major allergens, sugar, stevia, sugar alcohols,                 artificial colors, or flavors. Nonetheless, please check the supplement facts list for any ingredients                 you may be sensitive to.                      Should my Mira Prenatal Supplements have an odor?                      The faint odor you might sense is a good sign! A lack of smell is actually cause for concern and                 indicates a dietary supplement uses low-quality ingredients. While you might notice an odd smell in our                 vitamins, this means you're taking a top-notch dietary supplement. Nevertheless, our experts included                 natural vanilla powder to make your consumption easier!                 These ingredients may have an odor:                 Vitamin A (strong odor)                 Vitamin K (strong odor)                 Thiamine - Vitamin B1 (sulfuric odor)                 Riboflavin - Vitamin B2 (mild odor)                 Niacinamide - Vitamin B3 (yeast-type odor)                 Biotin (sulfuric odor)                 Selenium (sulfuric odor)                 Choline (amine or 'fishy' odor)                      How were Mira Prenatal Supplements developed?

As a health provider, I find that Mira’s quantitative measures far outweigh most qualitative                 over-the-counter kits. Mira is far more useful in clinical applications. We utilize Mira with our                 patients to help them successfully monitor, track and succeed in achieving pregnancies.”                  Meir Olcha, MD. Medical advisor and partner at Mira.

With Mira, I can see hormone patterns throughout many days of the cycle, over multiple months. This has                 provided clinical insight I have never had access to before, and allows me to tailor treatments in a                 much more individualized way. This personalized approach has helped patients become pregnant at                 significantly higher rates than standard, traditional, and generic fertility protocols.”                  Erin Foran Wolff, MD Partner at Mira.

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor.  After trying naturally and then going through multiple rounds of fertility treatments, Patricia and her husband were successful in their first month using Mira! Read their story to see how Mira helped Patricia track her cycle and give conception the best effort possible. When you’re young and relatively healthy you never expect to have problems trying for a baby. In fact, you’ve spent so long making sure that didn’t happen that it can be quite shocking when you decide to start trying and run into complications. So when Patricia and her husband, both healthy individuals in their mid-twenties, weren’t having any luck after several months they knew something was off.   “Just keep trying” Knowing when you ovulate is key to getting pregnant so Patricia started checking to see when she ovulated with ClearBlue ovulation kits. Two months and many tests later, Patricia still wasn’t able to identify when she was ovulating, but chalked it up to inexperience and not really knowing what to look for.  So she educated herself by meeting with a primary care provider and learning about her cycle, but that meeting left her less than satisfied.   Advice like “just keep trying” or “try having sex like 18 year olds” certainly sounded like fun, but it wasn’t exactly the medical advice Patricia was searching for. In a desperate attempt to implement the provider’s advice, the couple booked a baby-making weekend in Las Vegas during what Patricia thought would be her ovulation window. But even “drinking and relaxing” like their provider suggested wasn’t the answer and not only was Patricia not pregnant, but she still hadn’t been able to confirm ovulation.  Fertility procedures  Frustrated and confused, Patricia started looking into studies and research on irregular cycles and ovulation. After stumbling across information on polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) a light went off and she made an appointment with another provider to investigate the issue.  A thorough work-up later, Patricia was diagnosed with PCOS and it was discovered she was only ovulating 1-4 times a year!  She was prescribed a drug known to stimulate ovulation in those with PCOS, Metformin, and told to keep trying. The couple gave it two more months of trying naturally before deciding to increase their chances with intrauterine insemination (IUI). IUI can be performed with or without drugs, but in Patricia’s case doctor’s knew she would need help to force ovulation and increase her chances of success. Doctors tried a combination of Letrozole and Ovidrel, common fertility drugs used to help stimulate ovulation with IUI procedures, but after 4 rounds Patricia still wasn’t pregnant. Frustrated but not ready to give up, they switched their efforts to hormone stimulated timed intercourse with Gonal F and Ovidrel. But after two unsuccessful rounds they knew their next step was IVF, an expensive and emotionally consuming experience that doesn’t guarantee success. They decided to take a break to give them time to weigh their options before taking such an expensive leap.   Trying other fertility products Before they even began trying, naturally or otherwise, Patricia had experimented with other fertility products to help pinpoint when she was ovulating.  She’d had no luck with OPKs but had been using a wearable ovulation tracker, the Ava bracelet, to also predict ovulation.  Her research on irregular cycles, and ultimate PCOS diagnosis, decreased her confidence in the bracelet.  The lack of effective data made it all but unusable for Patricia and her irregular cycles so eventually she stopped using it.  In her PCOS research she stumbled across Mira, and although she didn’t have much hope after using the Ava bracelet, she figured it couldn’t hurt.   After months of trying to understand her cycle and what was happening with her body throughout the month, she finally found something that gave her hope.  She still struggled to pinpoint exactly when she was ovulating, but Mira helped her identify a fertile window for the couple to take advantage of to increase their chances of conceiving.   Through testing and reading the instructional data on Mira’s website, Patricia was able to better understand what was happening with her body throughout the month.  In fact, within her first month of using the device she was able to identify when she was at peak ovulation – for the first time!  The couple took advantage of that information and made sure they didn’t miss their baby-making window.   Weeks later, Patricia decided to take a pregnancy test on a whim. To her surprise it was positive! After all of the adversity they had faced, and the challenge of figuring out ovulation, she was finally pregnant.     Though they faced adversity, Patricia and her husband never gave up.  With a baby girl due in September 2022, the couple is over the moon and ready for the challenges parenthood will bring.   Life after Mira Being diagnosed with PCOS can certainly be frustrating, but it wasn’t the end of trying to conceive for Patricia and her husband. Mira helped Patricia understand her cycle, even with irregular hormones, and helped her manage her expectations while also giving conception her best efforts. This is just the start for Patricia though, she plans to continue using the device when trying for all of her future children.         How Mira Works with PCOS Unlike other methods for ovulation prediction, Mira works with your body.

Affecting 10 percent of women, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of infertility in women. Women with PCOS often have polycystic ovaries (read about the difference between PCO and PCOS here). This means that the ovaries have many tiny, benign and painless cysts. During an ultrasound, the tiny cysts may resemble a string of pearls. Or, women with PCOS may have high testosterone or lack of ovulation (irregular or no period). While it can be frustrating and disheartening when diagnosed with PCOS, it’s not the end of trying to conceive. Remember, you have to ovulate to get pregnant and there are ways to get your body to ovulate. If you have PCOS, one of the best things you can do is to educate yourself and be proactive about your health. That means working with your doctor, maybe taking medication, and changing your diet. Discover the facts about PCOS, what you can do if you’re diagnosed to help your body conceive.

Possible Reasons Why You Can't Get Pregnant FAQs About Not Getting Pregnant When To Get Help    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      When you were growing up, it might have seemed like getting pregnant was as simple as having unprotected sex. Unfortunately, when you’re actually ready to get pregnant, you quickly learn that this is not the case. Often, it takes months of trying for couples without fertility issues to conceive — and it may take years for those who do struggle with infertility.  12% of women ages 15 to 44 in the United States face difficulty conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term. This process can be discouraging, especially when you have been trying to conceive (TTC) for a long time without succeeding. So, why, exactly, is it so hard to get pregnant, even when you don’t have underlying health issues? The complicated answer is that factors like timing, biology, and environment can all interact to make your journey to conception straightforward or more difficult. Whether or not you struggle with infertility, here are some of the reasons why you may find it hard to conceive. Is It Hard To Get Pregnant? Yes, getting pregnant can be hard, both physically and emotionally! Your fertile window is a small amount of time each month so it may take some time for conception to occur. (For reference, a healthy woman in her 30s only has a 20% chance of getting pregnant during each menstrual cycle.) According to research, it can take up to one year for a healthy, fertile couple to conceive. Another study found that it takes an average of 78 sex sessions for a couple to get pregnant. All of this is considered perfectly normal and should not be cause for medical concern — though it’s completely understandable to have some worries throughout the process. Possible Reasons Why You Can’t Get Pregnant Without a medical exam, it’s impossible to say for certain why you are having trouble getting pregnant. That being said, there are a number of possible reasons why you may face difficulty conceiving. Finding it challenging to conceive does not necessarily mean that you (or your partner) are dealing with a serious medical problem. Other factors, like lifestyle and environment, can also influence your ability to get pregnant. Lifestyle Factors Making It Hard to Get Pregnant Stress Stress can influence many areas of our lives, not least of all the female reproductive system. A recent study found that stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in women, which may have an inhibitory effect on the reproductive system. Stress also causes widespread inflammation, which can also take a toll on your hormonal and reproductive health. As a result, you might experience delayed ovulation or other issues that impact your ability to conceive normally. While stress cannot directly cause infertility, it is associated with lower odds of conception. When TTC, doctors recommend minimizing the amount of stress in your life as much as possible. Of course, to a certain extent, stress is an inevitable part of life. Work and interpersonal relationships, for example, can’t be avoided! The best thing you can do to deal with these unavoidable stressors is to learn to cope with stress in a healthy, productive way. Techniques like meditation, yoga, and acupuncture may all be helpful for reducing stress and improving your ability to conceive (you can also look into fertility tea and crystals for fertility). Weight Fluctuation What is considered a normal, healthy weight varies from woman to woman. However, it’s important to determine and achieve your ideal weight before getting pregnant, since excessive weight gain or loss can negatively impact your ability to conceive. Both your ovaries and your adipose (fat) tissue produce estrogen, a pregnancy hormone that helps regulate your menstrual cycle and ovulation. Having excess fat can result in estrogen dominance, making it more challenging for you to get pregnant. Likewise, if you are underweight, your body may not produce enough estrogen in order for you to ovulate regularly. Some research says that a little weight loss may help improve fertility but it’s important to aim for a healthy BMI rather than just weight (a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9):  Having a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered ‘overweight’ A BMI over 30 is considered ‘obese.’ Having a BMI under 18.5 is considered ‘underweight.’  Some modifications to your eating habits and exercise regimen may help you with fertility too, but a quick fix is not the solution. If you’re struggling with weight gain or loss, speak with your doctor to come up with a plan to get you to the healthiest weight for your unique body. Sleep Habits Sleep is a critical component of your physical and emotional health and well-being. Lack of sleep can impact your cognitive thinking, emotional intelligence, weight, and menstrual cycle. Everyone feels cranky after a bad night’s sleep — but good sleep hygiene is especially important for women who are TTC as sleep plays a crucial role in keeping your reproductive hormones in balance. Healthy sleep habits include going to bed and waking up at the same time every day (yes, even on weekends!), keeping your room at a cool temperature, discontinuing the use of electronics 30 minutes before bedtime, and winding down before bed with a good book or some relaxation exercises. If you try these tips and still can’t catch some zzzs, speak to your doctor as you might be dealing with a more serious sleep issue. Diet Another important piece of your overall health that plays strongly into your fertility is your diet. A balanced pre-pregnancy diet not only helps you maintain a healthy weight, but also promotes good hormonal health and regular ovulation. If you are not getting enough of important prenatal nutrients such as folic acid, fiber, iron, and calcium, your body may not be able to support a healthy pregnancy. Avoiding processed foods and foods high in sugar in favor of lean proteins, whole grains, and fresh produce may make it easier for you to conceive. Age As much as we would like to believe that age is only a number, that isn’t necessarily true when it comes to conception. Your age does impact your ability to get pregnant, since the number and quality of eggs in your ovaries declines as you get older. Your fertility generally begins to decrease after age 30 and declines significantly after age 35. While it’s certainly possible to get pregnant in your 40s, your risk of birth defects (such as Down Syndrome) and miscarriage is significantly higher. If you are struggling to get pregnant due to age, using assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF with donor eggs, may help. Talk to your doctor to find out more about your options. Medical Factors Making It Hard to Get Pregnant Unexplained Infertility Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after one year of trying (if you are under age 35) or six months of trying (if you are over age 35). Some medical causes of infertility, such as endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), are clear, but many are not. Almost one-third of couples facing infertility are diagnosed with unexplained infertility, meaning there is no clear medical reason why they cannot conceive. The good news is that many couples in this camp are able to go on to conceive naturally; however, an unexplained infertility diagnosis can be difficult news to digest. Endometriosis Endometriosis is a reproductive disorder in which tissue similar to that of the uterine lining, or endometrium, grows elsewhere in the body. This foreign tissue can cause widespread inflammation; it also bleeds during your menstrual period, just like the endometrium. As a result, women with endometriosis can experience debilitating pelvic pain, heavy periods, painful sex, and other unpleasant symptoms. If endometriosis grows on or otherwise blocks the ovaries or fallopian tubes, it may impact your ability to conceive naturally (more on endometriosis and pregnancy here). Laparoscopic excision surgery can help your doctor assess how much endometriosis may affect your fertility and remove the endometriosis tissue, which can sometimes help you get pregnant more easily. If you suspect you may have endometriosis, talk to your OB/GYN about your symptoms to begin the path to diagnosis. Blocked Fallopian Tubes You may also have difficulty getting pregnant if one or both fallopian tubes are blocked. Usually, these blockages are caused by endometriosis or scar tissue from previous surgeries or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). When the fallopian tubes are blocked, the egg cannot travel from the ovary in order to be fertilized, impairing your fertility. If only one fallopian tube is blocked, you may eventually be able to get pregnant; however, if both are blocked, you will need to have the blockages removed surgically in order to get pregnant. A fertility specialist can tell you for certain if you might be dealing with a blocked fallopian tube (or two). Partner’s Medical Issues Sometimes, you may be perfectly healthy but still unable to conceive. In this case, it’s important to have your partner checked out by a fertility specialist as men can also suffer from medical issues that can impact their ability to conceive. It’s thought that of the 1 in 7 heterosexual couples dealing with infertility, 30-50% of infertility cases are due to male factor infertility, or infertility that originates with medical issues on the man’s side. There are many issues that can cause male infertility, but most have to do with sperm or ejaculation. When you talk to a fertility specialist, make sure your partner also gets tested for potential fertility problems so you can rule out male factor infertility. FAQs About Not Getting Pregnant Being unable to conceive when you want to get pregnant is one of the most difficult and confusing things you can go through as a couple. If you are struggling in your TTC journey, you might still have a lot of lingering questions about what exactly is going on in your body. In this section, we’ll answer some of the most commonly asked questions regarding difficulties getting pregnant.    I’m Having Regular Periods But Not Getting Pregnant?  Irregular cycles are not the only reason you can struggle to get pregnant. It’s definitely possible to have difficulty conceiving with regular cycles. That’s because periods aren’t the only part of the cycle that you should be paying attention to. If you have trouble conceiving, we always recommend tracking your periods with the Mira digital fertility analyzer, even if everything seems normal. Other important stuff happens when you aren’t bleeding, and following your cycle with Mira can help you understand your hormones—especially luteinizing hormone (LH). This allows you to know the opportune time to have intercourse for TTC.    I’m Ovulating But Not Getting Pregnant?  Again, problems with ovulation are not the only cause of fertility issues. A wide variety of health issues can make conceiving difficult. If it hasn’t been a year since you started trying (or six months if you are over age 35), you may simply need to continue doing what you are doing. However, if it has been longer than this, the best thing to do is to schedule an appointment with a fertility specialist. A fertility specialist, or reproductive endocrinologist, can evaluate both you and your partner to help you pinpoint exactly why you might be having troubling getting pregnant. With that knowledge, you can determine the best way to start a family despite struggling with infertility.    I’ve Been Trying To Get Pregnant For More Than 1 Year With No Success?  If you have been TTC for longer than one year, it is always a good idea to schedule an appointment with a fertility specialist. A fertility specialist, or reproductive endocrinologist, can perform specialized tests to help you pinpoint exactly why you and your partner are struggling to conceive. They can also identify and treat potential health issues or suggest targeted lifestyle changes based on your individual situation. Without seeing a doctor, you can’t know for certain why you and your partner have been unable to conceive so far.      When To Get Help To reiterate, it’s always a good idea to see a fertility specialist if you have been TTC for more than one year (or six months if you are over age 35) with no success. You can start by scheduling an appointment with your PCP or OB/GYN, who can refer you to a fertility specialist they trust. A fertility specialist will talk to you and your partner about your health and potentially run more tests to evaluate your fertility and help pinpoint why you have not been able to conceive.

Idiopathic Infertility or Unexplained Infertility? Potential Causes of Unexplained Infertility Getting Help vs. Making Lifestyle Changes    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      An unexplained infertility diagnosis can be devastating, leaving you feeling helpless and out-of-control. Unlike other types of infertility, it may not be as clear why you are struggling to get pregnant or what you can do about it.  If you are facing unexplained infertility, you are not alone: approximately 30% of couples worldwide struggle with unexplained infertility. In other words, doctors haven’t been able to identify a clear reason why the couple cannot conceive. Doctors used to use a “wait-and-see” approach for unexplained infertility, but this is now changing. Today, many researchers say that unexplained infertility just means the explanation hasn’t been found yet — not that an explanation is impossible (if you’re suffering from secondary infertility check out our guide here). A variety of potential causes have since been identified for unexplained infertility. In this article, we’ll go over eight of the most significant ones, and what they mean for your unexplained infertility diagnosis. What is unexplained infertility? Infertility, defined as the inability to conceive after trying naturally for one year (or six months if you are over age 35), affects 12% of women worldwide. Sometimes, infertility is caused by a medical problem, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis. However, many times, doctors are not able to identify a clear reason why couples cannot conceive on their own. This may lead them to give a diagnosis of unexplained infertility. Ideally, doctors say that an unexplained infertility diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it should only be given after a full workup is done on both the woman and her male partner that fails to determine another cause of infertility. A full infertility evaluation includes semen analysis, ovulation tracking, assessment of ovarian reserve, imaging, and, in some cases, laparoscopic surgery to visualize the reproductive organs. What are the chances of getting pregnant with unexplained infertility? Receiving an unexplained infertility diagnosis can be heartbreaking, but it does not necessarily mean that you will be unable to conceive. Some studies even show that women with unexplained infertility go on to conceive naturally in many cases. One six-month study found that 32% of women who received no treatment were able to conceive naturally, and one-third of women were able to conceive with intrauterine insemination (IUI), a type of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Another study found that expected management, or the “wait-and-see” approach, was slightly more effective than the use of Clomid, a fertility medication, in women with unexplained infertility. So, whether or not you choose to use fertility treatments or to go at it without any fertility support, couples with unexplained infertility do have the possibility of conceiving. Your doctor will help you decide which option is best for you while taking into consideration your age and overall health. Idiopathic Infertility or Unexplained Infertility? When sperm quality is normal, a woman is ovulating regularly, and a laparoscopy does not show damage to the pelvic organs, the cause of infertility is said to be unexplained. In other words, unexplained infertility is diagnosed when there is no medical reason, on paper at least, why the couple should be unable to conceive. Other times, a couple’s fertility workup may discover changes in sperm quality or ovulation that are abnormal but cannot be explained by another medical condition. This is known as idiopathic infertility. When the workup finds unexplained problems with the man’s sperm, doctors call it idiopathic male infertility; when the woman is not ovulating as she should for unknown reasons, it is called idiopathic female infertility. Potential Causes of Unexplained Infertility The idea that there could be a “cause” of unexplained infertility, which is supposed to have no clear cause, seems counterintuitive. However, more and more experts believe that unexplained infertility is not truly unexplainable, but rather, caused by a variable that hasn’t been identified yet. They have even started to theorize about what some of those potential causes may be. Below, we’ll list eight of the potential causes doctors have identified for unexplained infertility and talk about how they impact your reproductive health. 1. Diet Folate, iron, and vitamins D, C, and B12 are the building blocks of fertility (as well as avoiding toxins). They maintain egg health, especially as you age, and ensure your ovaries are timing the release of your eggs so they’re more likely to be fertilized. Studies show that women who are anemic (deficient in iron, vitamin B12, or both) are at risk for having anovulatory cycles, and almost 50% of women whose vitamin D levels measure below 20ng/mL are unable to get pregnant. The good news is that a Harvard study showed that women who changed five lifestyle factors, one of which was shifting to a fertility diet, saw an 80% reduction in infertility due to ovulatory disorders. 2. Genes Chromosomal polymorphism is when a portion of one chromosome has been transferred to another (translocation) or a piece of a chromosome has been flipped upside down (inversion). If you have either of these conditions but your partner does not, the genetic material carried in your egg and his sperm won’t be able to combine. Chromosomal polymorphism affects roughly 4% of the population, but a study published in July of 2017 found that chromosomal polymorphism was disproportionately present in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility. The good news is that if you both have the same chromosomal polymorphism, researchers believe it won’t affect your fertility at all. 3. Sperm Researchers at the Queen’s University Belfast tested sperm from men in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility and they found that 80% of them had DNA-damaged sperm. Most of the male population has at least some sperm with DNA damage. And as long as those damaged sperm make up less than 15% of the total sperm supply, there’s no effect on fertility. The problem comes when damaged sperm counts reach 25% or more of the total sperm supply. The researchers found when at least 25% of a man’s sperm showed DNA damage, the couple’s chance of having a baby dropped even with fertility treatment. 4. Mild Endometriosis When infertility is due to endometriosis, it is not, technically, considered “unexplained.” However, mild forms of endometriosis may be more difficult for doctors to identify, even with diagnostic laparoscopy. As a result, you may receive an unexplained infertility diagnosis, when the problem is really stage I or stage II endometriosis. During a laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis, most doctors look for the characteristic “gun-powder” lesions that are black, dark brown, or blue. But endometriosis may also be red or even clear, making it harder to see with the naked eye. If the surgeon who performs your diagnostic laparoscopy is not well-trained in diagnosing and treating endometriosis, it is easy to miss these more atypical endometriosis lesions during surgery. 5. Tubal Damage Another cause of infertility that is easily missed is tubal factor infertility or TFI. TFI is caused when the fallopian tubes are blocked by scar tissue, called adhesions. These adhesions can be caused by endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or another medical condition. Many doctors use a form of imaging called a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to identify TFI. In HSG, dye is injected into the uterus to illuminate the fallopian tubes before taking an X-ray. This makes it easier to identify potential blockages of the fallopian tubes on imaging. Even if HSG finds that your tubes are not blocked, however, there may still be adhesions that cannot be seen on this test. Thus, if your doctor does not perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to visualize potential adhesions, TFI can be missed, and you might be stuck with an unexplained infertility diagnosis. 6. Premature Ovarian Failure Premature ovarian failure, or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), occurs when a woman’s ovaries stop functioning normally before age 40. In approximately 90% of POI cases, the exact cause is unknown. On paper, it may appear that nothing is wrong, meaning that you could receive a diagnosis of unexplained infertility. It’s still possible to get pregnant naturally with POI. Certain genetic disorders, diseases, and cancer treatments make a woman more likely to develop POI. However, when the cause of POI is unknown, it could potentially be related to lifestyle factors. If this is the case, then improving your lifestyle, including your diet, may help you get pregnant, even with POI. 7. Immunological Infertility Immunological infertility describes an autoimmune response to sperm that may be present in one or both partners. In a person with immunological infertility, the body produces more anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) than the average person. The ASA can attack sperm, either in the male body prior to ejaculation or in the female body before the sperm is able to fertilize an egg, resulting in infertility. More research is needed to fully assess how immunological infertility works and how it can be treated. Immunological infertility is a lesser-known cause of infertility that may be overlooked by some fertility doctors, leading you to be diagnosed with unexplained infertility instead. 8. Egg Quality In women, it isn’t enough to simply ovulate each month. The egg that is released must be of high enough quality to be able to be fertilized and implanted in the womb. Low-quality eggs are unable to be fertilized due to genetic mutations, and the number of genetically abnormal eggs increases in frequency as women age. Egg quality declines naturally over age 35 for this reason, but it can also be affected by controllable lifestyle factors, such as diet, environmental toxins, and psychological stress. Thus, if your unexplained infertility is due to egg quality issues, you may be able to improve your egg quality by addressing these factors. Getting Help vs. Making Lifestyle Changes Nobody wants to deal with fertility issues, and going to the doctor can make those fertility problems seem more real. When it comes to unexplained infertility, many doctors still use the “wait-and-see” approach anyway. So, is there anything you can do about unexplained infertility on your own before going to see your doctor? If you have been trying to get pregnant for over one year (or six months if you are over age 35) and have not yet seen a fertility specialist, you should make a doctor’s appointment for an official diagnosis of unexplained infertility before trying any lifestyle adjustments. However, if you have been diagnosed with unexplained infertility and told to “wait-and-see” before trying fertility treatments, you may want to take a look at your diet, potential environmental exposures, and psychological stress to see if improving these can help you get pregnant naturally.

What is PCOS? How do you treat PCO vs. PCOS? Fertility with PCO vs. PCOS Tracking Ovulation with PCO vs. PCOS    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      One of the hallmarks of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is polycystic ovaries (PCO) — but what you might not know is that not all women with PCO have PCOS. There is a subtle but important difference between the conditions of PCO and PCOS.  If you are looking to get pregnant with either PCO or PCOS, it’s even more important to understand the nuances of each condition. Each condition can impact your fertility in different ways, as well as your overall health. What is PCO? Polycystic ovaries, or PCO, affect 1 in 4 women of reproductive age. Most women with PCO find out during a routine ultrasound, though some may experience mild symptoms. It is considered a common variant of normal ovaries. PCO are commonly mistaken for PCOS, even though the conditions are different. Studies show that while PCO are a necessary component for the diagnosis of PCOS, women with PCO often lack other features required for diagnosing PCOS. The primary difference between PCO and PCOS is how it affects female hormones. Research indicates that women with PCO do not quite have PCOS, but do not quite have “normal” hormone levels either. Their hormone measurements lie somewhere between those of “normal” women and those of women with PCOS. Symptoms  Some experience irregular periods or ovulation and/or mild pelvic pain. However, most experience no symptoms at all.  Diagnosis PCO is diagnosed via ultrasound. Usually, women with PCO have no symptoms. They go in for an ultrasound, either for pregnancy or another condition, and find out incidentally that they have PCO. Occasionally, they may have irregular periods or ovulation and/or mild pelvic pain, prompting their provider to order an ultrasound to examine the ovaries. Findings of multiple ovarian follicles on ultrasound are suggestive of PCO. What is PCOS? Polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, is less common than PCO, but still highly prevalent. PCOS is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 10 women who go into the gynecologist’s office with complaints. PCO are a component of PCOS, but PCO alone do not indicate PCOS. Unlike PCO, which are considered a common variant of normal ovaries, PCOS is a metabolic condition characterized by abnormal hormone levels. Women with PCOS have high levels of androgens, or male sex hormones, as well as high levels of estrogen. Resistance to insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar, is also common in those with PCOS. Most women with PCOS have symptoms, unlike women with PCO. Some of those symptoms are described in the section that follows. Symptoms  Polycystic ovaries (PCO) Pelvic pain Irregular periods  Menstrual cycles shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days, and/or fewer than six menstrual periods per year Heavy menstrual flow   Overweight or obesity Insulin resistance Excess facial and body hair (hirsutism) Acne Male pattern baldness  Diagnosis In order to make a diagnosis of PCOS, two out of three of the following elements must be present:   Irregular periods. Irregular, infrequent, or prolonged menstrual cycles are the most common sign of PCOS.  Excess androgens. Abnormally high male sex hormones (androgens) are responsible for symptoms like hirsutism, acne, and overweight.  Polycystic ovaries. PCO is a sign of PCOS but is not the only element required for a diagnosis of PCOS.  Your doctor may be able to diagnose PCOS on examination if you have obvious signs, such as hirsutism and irregular periods. Sometimes, they may order additional tests, such as hormone tests or an ultrasound to detect PCO. How do you treat PCO vs. PCOS? Because PCO is a common variant of normal ovaries, it does not usually require treatment. If you are having other symptoms of PCOS, however, your doctor may recommend one of the following treatment options:   Hormonal birth control. Hormonal birth control is the first line of treatment for PCOS. Birth control pills combat PCOS by lowering androgen levels, regulating periods, and reducing acne.  Clomid is an oral medication prescribed to help women with PCOS ovulate regularly. Clomid can help make your periods more predictable and improve your fertility with PCOS.  Other medications. Some medications are not FDA-approved to treat PCOS but are frequently used off-label to treat it. Examples include spironolactone, an anti-acne drug that reduces androgen levels, and metformin, a medication that improves insulin resistance.  Weight loss. Many women with PCOS are overweight and/or have insulin resistance, which contributes to a high risk of type II diabetes. Losing a safe amount of bodyweight under your doctor’s supervision may reduce this risk.  Fertility with PCO vs. PCOS Women with PCO can still get pregnant. Occasionally, the presence of multiple follicles on the ovaries may interfere with the regularity of their menstrual cycle and/or ovulation. As a result, it may be more difficult — but not impossible — to get pregnant. For women with PCOS, because of the hormonal component of PCOS, getting pregnant may be much harder — yet it is still possible with fertility treatments. As Advanced Fertility puts it, getting pregnant with PCOS is less a question of whether fertility treatment will work, and more a question of which fertility treatment will work. The first line of treatment for women with PCOS who are trying to conceive (TTC) is a course of Clomid to help them ovulate regularly. Normally, a woman under 35 has a 25% chance of getting pregnant each month; women under 35 with PCOS who are treated with Clomid have a 15% chance of pregnancy each month. Of the women who are able to ovulate on Clomid, about half successfully become pregnant. If a woman with PCOS fails to become pregnant after one year of treatment with Clomid, she is considered Clomid-resistant. In this case, your doctor might recommend in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment to help you conceive. According to one study, approximately 1 in 4 women with PCOS who are resistant to Clomid were able to get pregnant after 60 cycles of IVF. Tracking Ovulation with PCO vs. PCOS One reason why getting pregnant with PCOS is more difficult is due to irregular ovulation. If it is more difficult to predict when you will ovulate, it can be more difficult to predict when to have sex in order to get pregnant. Women with PCO sometimes also have irregular cycles, which can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, this is less common in women with PCO than in women with PCOS. How Mira can help you get pregnant Using a digital fertility tracker like Mira can help you determine the exact date of ovulation using the fertility hormone concentrations measured in your urine, the same way an at-home pregnancy test detects pregnancy hormones. It is 99% accurate at predicting ovulation, even in women with irregular cycles due to PCOS.  Many women who are TTC first turn to drugstore ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) to help them predict their ovulation. OPKs detect the LH surge that occurs after ovulation to let you know when you are ovulating. They do this by comparing your LH level to an LH threshold — which can result in false-positive results for women with PCOS, who naturally have high LH. Women with PCOS have high baseline LH and may get positive results from drugstore OPKs all month long, making it confusing to determine when you are ovulating. Mira, on the other hand, charts your exact hormone concentrations, allowing you to differentiate smaller LH peaks from the LH surge occurring during ovulation for more accurate predictions.

Are you frustrated with symptoms like uncontrollable acne, unexplained weight gain, and/or unwanted hair growth (or loss)?  If these symptoms sound familiar, you could have undiagnosed PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). The condition, which affects approximately 8-13% of reproductive-aged women worldwide, is caused by an underlying hormone imbalance and can lead to irregular cycles, acne and excessive hair growth, and even infertility.   Despite the prevalence of PCOS, up to 70% of those affected remain undiagnosed. If you think you may be among the 70%, take our short 2-minute PCOS Symptoms Quiz to learn more about what your chances of having PCOS may look like.  Take the PCOS Symptoms Quiz This quiz is designed to help you reflect on your body, menstrual cycle, and day-to-day symptoms. Your results will show whether or not your symptoms are aligned with the common symptoms of PCOS.   Please note that this self-assessment quiz is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for medical advice.  6 Quick Tips for Managing Symptoms of PCOS  If you think you may have PCOS, here are a few practical tips for managing the condition in your daily life.  Speak with your doctor First things first: speak with your doctor.  There are several different treatment strategies for PCOS. Some of these strategies involve medication (such as hormonal birth control, Metformin, Clomiphene, or Letrozole) and others may focus more on lifestyle. A doctor can help you find a treatment plan that best suits your medical history, symptoms, and fertility goals.  Get to know your hormones There is a lot you can learn about your body and hormone patterns – and you don’t even have to leave the house!  For example, Mira’s Panorama Lab Test screens for AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone), TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone), fT4 (Free Thyroxine), Prolactin, and Free Testosterone – five key biomarkers that can help you see whether or not your overall hormone levels are in balance. You can also keep track of key reproductive hormones (such as Luteinizing Hormone, Estrone Glucuronide, and Pregnanediol Glucuronide) with the help of Mira’s at-home hormone monitor and app. Through regular hormone monitoring, you can track your unique cycle in real time and see a complete picture of your hormone curves. Strive for a balanced diet Individuals with PCOS also often struggle with insulin resistance. A balanced diet can help to increase insulin sensitivity while also helping to promote a healthy weight – both of which can improve menstrual cycle regularity and ovulation.  When it comes to maintaining a balanced diet with PCOS, doctors often recommend incorporating lots of whole grains, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins into daily meal planning.  You can learn more about PCOS-friendly nutrition in our article 10 PCOS Fertility Diet Tips.  Supplement your diet There are a number of different supplements that can be helpful for balancing overall hormone levels. Mira’s own PCOS Supplements contain Myo & D-Chiro Inositol (40:1 ideal ratio) with Folate & Vitamin D, to support ovarian health, promote hormone balance, and improve metabolism.  You can learn more about PCOS-friendly supplements in our article 12 PCOS Supplements & Vitamins to Help Your Body + Hormones.  Move your body with exercise Exercise is such a powerful tool for improving insulin resistance, managing weight, and balancing hormones. In fact, one study even found that exercise therapy helped to restore regular periods in 60% of PCOS patients.  Remember – exercise doesn’t have to be extreme! Even something as simple as taking regular walks around your neighborhood still counts as exercise, and it’s great for your body. The most important thing to focus on is finding an exercise routine that you enjoy and that you can commit to doing regularly.  Consider working with a fertility coach Whether your goal is to get pregnant with PCOS or simply balance your hormones, a fertility coach can help you make it happen. Fertility coaches typically have backgrounds in nursing or similar fields (such as occupational therapy), and they can help you with things like tracking your menstrual cycle, understanding your hormone patterns, and implementing any lifestyle changes. They also provide emotional support throughout the process.  Ready to work with a fertility coach? Check out Mira’s Hormone Health Clinic for Fertility.      Need fertility guidance from a pro?

As a metabolic disorder, the first line of defense against PCOS always involves nutritional and lifestyle intervention and research has shown that several vitamins and supplements may help those with PCOS manage the condition. In this post we’ll review some of the most common and effective PCOS supplements and how they help combat certain symptoms.  Supplements can be a way to support healthy hormones but they can also be a recipe for expensive urine or even cause additional problems.  We’ll help you figure out what works, why it works, and what the science says about common PCOS supplements.   What is PCOS? (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a hormone and metabolic condition that affects nearly 1 in 10 women of reproductive age and is among the leading causes of infertility. PCOS is characterized by abnormal hormone levels and blood sugar regulation problems.  Women with PCOS have high levels of androgens, or male sex hormones, as well as imbalance estrogen and progesterone. The hormonal imbalance that accompanies PCOS can lead to cystic ovaries and a chronic lack of ovulation, making it hard to get pregnant.  The condition is notoriously hard to diagnose, though common symptoms include irregular periods, excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, infertility, and weight gain.   It’s not clear what causes PCOS and likely involves a mix of genetic and environmental factors.  However, when diagnosed, PCOS is highly manageable through fundamental lifestyle changes and dietary supplements.      Can supplements really help PCOS?  The most common treatments for PCOS are usually based on lifestyle modifications like exercise and diet, but this also includes nutrient supplementation therapy. It’s important to note though that dietary supplements are regulated differently around the world and can actually interfere with other treatments and medications.  It is always best to speak to your doctor before taking any supplement especially if you are trying to conceive or hope to conceive in the future.  Safety aside, several vitamins and supplements help regulate hormonal imbalances and promote ovulation which can be especially helpful for those with PCOS.  They can be an excellent addition to your PCOS management plan but it’s important to look at the research to understand how they can help and whether they will work for you.     PCOS Supplements  The following supplements are commonly used to help women with PCOS and have the most evidence-based support behind them.  Most work to manage insulin resistance, metabolism, and hormone balance but can have a range of other health benefits.            Fish oil  Inflammation and insulin resistance are two key factors in PCOS and both can negatively impact fertility as well as your general health.  Fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties and can improve insulin resistance making it a key supplement for those with PCOS.  Research has also demonstrated that supplementing with fish oil can help improve ovulation, ovarian reserve, and overall fertility.   Aside from helping with PCOS treatment, fish oil has a host of other health benefits for women including brain and eye development for a baby  as well as preventing heart disease and declining mental function.        Probiotics  Research has found an association between PCOS and the gut microbiota but the underlying link is still unclear.  Probiotics are one way to create a healthier balance of gut bacteria by introducing live bacteria and yeasts that support a healthy colony of bacteria and other microorganisms in the gut.  This can help those with PCOS and studies show that your gut microbiome plays a role in metabolism, although the effects are modest.   Probiotics also help improve hormonal balance and reduce inflammation, a key contributor to insulin resistance.  Research has shown that taking probiotic supplements can help women with PCOS and may help with other symptoms by stabilizing the menstrual cycle and balancing hormone levels.   Zinc  Zinc is an essential mineral for all humans and plays a role in many bodily functions including cell growth, hormone release, and reproductive functions.  In fact, it is essential for proper functioning of the reproductive system in both males and females and zinc deficiency can have serious health implications.  Less is known about its impact on the female reproductive system but studies have suggested zinc deficiency could play a role in several conditions that affect the area like issues with menstruation.   Women with PCOS have shown positive results from zinc supplementation especially in terms of insulin resistance, but it’s also been shown to help other PCOS symptoms like acne, hair growth, hair loss, as well as improve hormonal imbalances and ovulation.     Vitamin D  Vitamin D isn’t found in the foods we eat, so most people need to supplement it in some other way.  Whether that’s through getting adequate sunshine or vitamins, getting enough vitamin D may lower inflammation, improve insulin resistance and regulate your menstrual cycle.   Studies show that up to 85% of women with PCOS suffer from vitamin D deficiency so adding this to your treatment plan may be particularly helpful.  Vitamin D is critical to your endocrine system and also helps regulate the absorption of calcium.  Supplementing with vitamin D can help with menstrual regularity and ovulation for women with PCOS in addition to its many other benefits.     Inositol  Up to 70% of women with PCOS have some level of insulin resistance.  Insulin is the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels and your body depends on those receptors working properly for a balanced metabolism.  While most know about insulin’s role in blood sugar regulation, it also plays a role in signaling the ovaries to produce certain hormones.   When the signaling system isn’t working properly, the body reacts by producing even more insulin which in turn causes a host of knock on effects that can impair follicle development and disrupt ovulation. Inositol is well known for its ability to improve insulin resistance and has been well studied.  It’s host of other benefits like promoting egg quality and improving ovarian function make it one of the best supplements for women with PCOS.   Resveratrol  You’ve likely heard much of the hype around this supplement from headlines claiming the benefits of red wine for cardiovascular health.  A compound found in various plants, resveratrol acts like an antioxidant as a defense against free radicals and oxidative damage in the body.  Oxidative stress is linked to many disorders and certainly plays a role in PCOS, though the exact relationship is still unclear.    In women with PCOS, supplementing with resveratrol has shown benefits for hormone balance and fertility, as well as improving insulin resistance.  Although it’s well tolerated as a supplement, not much is known about the risks to pregnant women or babies in utero and it could interact with other supplements or medications.       Carnitine  Another antioxidant, carnitine, or Acetyl L-Carnitine (ALC) helps the body turn fat into energy.  Low levels may be linked to several common traits of PCOS like insulin resistance and higher levels of androgens.  Carnitine has proven to be effective at managing issues with inflammation and glucose metabolism.  Although more research is needed in the area, researchers are impressed with carnitine’s impact on PCOS markers and it is a popular supplement used for weight loss.         NAC (N-Acetyl-Cysteine)  Like other antioxidants, NAC works to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the body.  Because women with PCOS tend to have higher levels of both, this is a great supplement to consider for treatment.  NAC has also been shown to lower testosterone levels, improve insulin resistance, and boost fertility.  It works by increasing the production of glutathione, an important antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage.   NAC helps regulate your menstrual cycle by promoting hormone balance and liver detoxification.  Even if you’re not trying to get pregnant, your menstrual cycle can say a lot about your health and an irregular cycle should be checked out.               Berberine  This herbal extract known for treating inflammation, diabetes, high cholesterol, and infertility can be particularly helpful for women with PCOS.  Aside from health benefits like decreasing cholesterol and improving insulin resistance, it can also increase ovulation rates and improve fertility treatment outcomes.  Commonly used in the treatment of metabolic diseases, some studies have even shown it to be as effective as metformin, a drug used to treat high blood sugar that is also prescribed to many women with PCOS for similar reasons. Berberine may help to balance your body’s endocrine responses and while most people can tolerate it, you should always consult with your healthcare provider before taking berberine.  It can interact with other medications and is not intended for long term use.        Magnesium  Some people call magnesium the miracle mineral due to its involvement in over 300 chemical reactions in the body and role in the proper growth and maintenance of bones. It also affects heart health and muscle function along with a host of other processes in the body.  Getting enough of this mineral is not only critical for your overall health, but especially important for women with PCOS as they are more likely to be magnesium deficient than the general population.  Not only can it help with the insulin resistance common to PCOS sufferers, but it can also reduce inflammation and minimize PMS symptoms.     Vitamin B12  Vitamin B12 helps lower inflammation in the body by breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.  Not only are homocysteine levels often elevated in PCOS patients, those higher levels are associated with reduced fertility, low birth weight, poor egg quality, miscarriage, and hypertension.  Supplementing with Vitamin B12 targets these levels to correct hormonal imbalances and improve fertility.  Some medications prescribed for PCOS, like metformin, can even drain your body of B vitamins making it an essential supplement with a wide range of benefits for anyone with PCOS.       Vitamin B9 (Folate)  Folate or Vitamin B9 also helps break down the amino acid homocysteine and lower inflammation.  It is essential to egg quality and growth, implantation, fetal growth, and organ development. It is especially useful if you’re trying to get pregnant and helps with mood and fatigue in addition to reducing high homocysteine levels.  Addressing underlying inflammation with B vitamins can reduce your risk for heart disease and even help reproductive issues.    Lifestyle Modifications to Support PCOS Treatment Fundamental lifestyle issues such as managing diet, sleep and stress levels, getting enough exercise, and improving gut health should all be addressed when you have PCOS.  These lifestyle modifications will have the biggest impact and support your treatment. Regular Exercise and PCOS Due to the hormonal imbalance, PCOS can make your body more susceptible to insulin resistance and lead to a host of problems, including weight gain.  Lack of physical activity is a known contributing factor to insulin resistance.  Incorporating more exercise into your routine can not only help combat it, but has been shown to reduce weight and overall body fat in patients with PCOS.     Stress Management Techniques for PCOS Women Stress is a normal and natural part of life, but stressful situations and chronic stress can both wreak havoc on your hormones.  A prolonged hormonal imbalance from stress hormones can lead to ovulation disruptions, missed periods or irregular periods.  There are a number of ways you can manage stress to help with the emotional, physical, and cognitive manifestations of stress.     Importance of Adequate Sleep for PCOS Management Sleep is critical to overall health and hormone functioning.  Research suggests that lack of sleep can interfere with certain hormone levels, especially those involving appetite.  Without adequate sleep, you can feel hungrier and more agitated, making you more likely to choose unhealthy foods at mealtimes.   The National Sleep Foundation advises that all adults need around 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.  If you have PCOS you may be more likely to experience sleep disturbances and feel tired throughout the day.  Getting enough sleep is crucial for PCOS management.         Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    PCOS supplement FAQ   Can Supplements Cure PCOS? PCOS is very treatable and supplements can play an important role in your treatment plan by filling in nutritional or mineral differences.  But supplements won’t work alone, for them to have the biggest impact, it’s important that you also focus on real dietary and lifestyle changes. Are There Any Side Effects of PCOS Supplements? Depending on the supplements you take, you may or may not experience side effects.  They are individual to each supplement and the person taking them.  However, research shows that many nutritional supplements are well tolerated by those with PCOS and produce few (if any) side effects.   How Long Does it Take for Supplements to Show Results in PCOS? There is no clear cut answer for this question since it will depend on individual circumstances.  It may take several months to notice improvements and will depend on what else you are doing to manage your condition. Can PCOS Supplements Interact with Other Medications? Always check with your doctor to see if the supplements you are taking will interact with any other medications.   What Should I Look for When Choosing PCOS Supplements? Choosing supplements of any kind can be challenging with the sheer volume of supplements available and the barrage of information about them.  Always choose supplements of high quality that have been tested by a third party to ensure the quality of the product.  Third Party Testing is not required by law, but can be an important indicator that the manufacturer is committed to producing high quality products.   Are PCOS Supplements Suitable for Pregnant Women? It is important to speak with your doctor about any supplements you are taking while pregnant.  This way you can ensure they won’t interfere with other medications and are safe for use during pregnancy.       Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Does PCOS cause weight gain?  Why does PCOS cause weight gain? Why is it hard to lose weight with PCOS?  How to lose weight with PCOS When to see a doctor for help with PCOS weight gain FAQs on PCOS & weight gain    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      One of the most frustrating symptoms of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is weight gain. What makes this symptom even more frustrating is that it can feel like – no matter how many diets you try or how many different exercises you do – those extra pounds just won’t come off.  To help, we’ll be discussing everything you need to know about PCOS weight gain including why it happens, what’s happening with your hormones, and what you can do to manage it.    What is PCOS? Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine condition with hormonal disruptions that can cause tiny, benign cysts to form in the ovaries. The cysts are painless, and they often resemble a small string of pearls in an ultrasound. Those who have PCOS may struggle to ovulate, and this can make it difficult to become pregnant. Researchers estimate that approximately 10% of women are affected by PCOS.  Does PCOS cause weight gain?  Yes. Weight gain is a common symptom of PCOS. This is because PCOS can lead to an overall imbalance of your hormones, which can affect things like your metabolism, hunger levels, and how your body stores fat. Other common symptoms of PCOS include irregular periods, difficulties with getting pregnant, acne, thinning of the hair, headaches, fatigue, mood swings, hirsutism, pelvic pain, and darkening of the skin.    Why does PCOS cause weight gain? PCOS can make your body more susceptible to insulin resistance. This means that the body has a difficult time converting sugars from foods into energy, and as a result, insulin and sugar build up in the bloodstream. When insulin levels are high, this causes the body to ramp up the production of certain male hormones. These male hormones are called androgens, and they can lead to the accumulation of excess weight around the stomach area. In addition to high androgen levels, PCOS can also cause an imbalance of estrogen which also makes the body more susceptible to weight gain.  PCOS weight gain is so hard to control because the root of the problem is a hormonal imbalance, which oftentimes cannot be treated through diet and exercise alone.  Body goes in fat storage mode When your body is resistant to insulin, your pancreas responds by producing even more insulin. When insulin levels are elevated, this leads to increased fat storage around the stomach and midsection.   You get hungrier Elevated insulin levels can also cause you to feel hungrier more often. It may also lead to intense food cravings, making it difficult to resist binging on high-calorie foods. Your appetite-suppressing hormones can be impaired When insulin levels are disrupted, this can lead to other food-related hormones being disrupted as well. For example, appetite-suppressing hormones like ghrelin, cholecystokinin, and leptin can all be affected when insulin levels are out of balance.  Why is it hard to lose weight with PCOS?  Again, it’s important to remember that weight gain due to PCOS has everything to do with your underlying hormone imbalance. This imbalance not only causes your body to store more fat, but it also causes you to feel hungrier more frequently – even after eating. This disruption to your hunger levels and appetite can make it extremely difficult to maintain a healthy diet since your body’s hunger signals are unreliable.         How to lose weight with PCOS Medication If you are struggling with PCOS, visiting your doctor is a natural first step toward controlling your symptoms and/or losing weight. Many symptoms of PCOS are out of your control, and your doctor can help you find suitable medication for your individual situation.  Please note that the following medications are for informational and educational purposes. Always speak with your doctor before starting a new medication.  Weight management medication Certain weight-loss medications, such as Orlistat, may be effective at helping PCOS patients lose weight. However, this medication is only effective when used alongside other weight-loss strategies like exercise and maintaining a healthy, well-balanced diet.  Oral contraceptives It’s also common for PCOS patients to be prescribed oral contraceptives. Even though they may not help you lose weight immediately, they can help to balance your overall hormones which may lead to better weight management in the long term. Bear in mind that oral contraceptives are not an appropriate medication if you are looking to plan a pregnancy in the near future.  Blood sugar medication Other medications, such as Liraglutide and Metformin, are designed to help regulate your blood sugar and insulin levels. In turn, this can help you lose weight easier. These medications are especially appropriate in cases where lifestyle changes (such as exercising more frequently and consuming fewer calories) have not worked.  Healthy habits In addition to exploring your PCOS medication options with your doctor, it’s also a good idea to examine your lifestyle. This is because things like what we eat, how often we exercise, and how much sleep we get can all play a big role in how our hormones work and stay regulated. Making necessary lifestyle adjustments is not easy, however, it is possible through dedication and keeping a positive mindset.   Reduce carb intake Of all the nutrients that we consume, carbohydrates are the ones that cause our blood sugar levels to rise the most. To prevent these blood sugar spikes (which can lead to insulin resistance), many doctors advise PCOS patients to follow a low-carb diet. This not only keeps blood sugar and insulin levels in check, but it can also help with weight loss. If it’s difficult for you to imagine a life with minimum carbs, consider starting small by making the following food swaps in your diet:  Replace tortilla wraps with lettuce wraps. Replace pasta noodles with zucchini noodles. Replace crackers with vegetables like cucumbers, celery, or carrots. Replace white rice with cauliflower rice or quinoa. Replace breadcrumbs with ground nuts.  Eat enough fiber Unlike carbs which can cause blood sugar levels to spike and then crash, foods that are high in fiber can help you feel satiated, full, and energized for much longer. By eating a fiber-rich diet, your blood sugar levels will stay balanced throughout the day, you’ll experience fewer cravings in between meals, and you can lose weight much more easily.  Consider incorporating the following high-fiber foods into your daily meals and snacks:   Fruits like pears, strawberries, avocados, apples, raspberries, and bananas  Vegetables like carrots, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, and spinach  Legumes like lentils, kidney beans, black beans, and chickpeas Grains like whole-wheat spaghetti, quinoa, bran flakes, oatmeal, and brown rice  Eat more fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables are packed with essential vitamins and nutrients that provide a wealth of benefits to your health. They are not only high in fiber (which can help you feel fuller for longer, leading to sustainable weight loss), but they are also high in antioxidants which can help to reduce inflammation caused by PCOS.  If you are struggling to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, consider the following tips:   When making a plate, fill half of it with fruit and vegetables before adding anything else. Always keep canned and/or frozen fruit and vegetables on hand to add to soups, stews, and stir frys. Don’t be afraid to get creative with herbs, spices, and cooking methods.  Challenge yourself to eat fruits and vegetables that cover the entire rainbow each day.   Limit processed foods and sugar Processed foods like sugary cereals, breads, cured meats, microwave meals, and snacks may be tasty and convenient, but they are packed with added salt, sugar, and fat that can hinder your PCOS weight loss efforts. These ingredients are oftentimes used to prolong the product’s shelf life without compromising on taste.  While you may not want to eliminate all processed foods from your diet, there are strategies that you can try to help minimize them.   Replace processed chips, crackers, and cookies with healthier snacks like fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Check food labels before purchasing – you might be surprised at just how high the salt and sugar content is. Plan meals ahead of time to avoid the temptation to cook a frozen dinner or order takeout.   Get enough sleep Sleep is critical to overall health and hormone functioning. In fact, research suggests that lack of sleep can interfere with your insulin, cortisol, ghrelin, and leptin levels. The result? You feel hungrier and more agitated, and you’re more likely to choose unhealthy foods at mealtimes.  So how much sleep is “enough”? The National Sleep Foundation advises that all adults need around 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. If you struggle to get that much sleep, consider the following techniques to improve your sleep hygiene.  Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Resist naps during the daytime. Limit caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening. Follow a bedtime routine. Avoid using electronics in bed.  Exercise regularly Lack of physical activity is a known contributing factor to insulin resistance. And by incorporating more exercise into your routine, you can help to combat it. Not only that, but regular exercise has also been shown to reduce weight and overall body fat in patients with PCOS.  If you’ve never had an exercise routine before, don’t panic! Even simple things like taking a walk or riding a bike can do wonders for easing PCOS symptoms. Here are a few tips to get started.   Choose an exercise that you can see yourself looking forward to. Find an activity to do with a friend.  Start by setting small goals and working yourself up from there.  Listen to your body, know your limits, and don’t beat yourself up over needing to take a day or two off.   When to see a doctor for help with PCOS weight gain If you are still continuing to gain weight due to PCOS, despite making positive lifestyle changes, it is a good time to speak with a medical professional. This is especially true if you are looking to plan a pregnancy soon and your weight gain is also accompanied by irregular periods.         FAQs on PCOS & weight gain What is a PCOS belly?  “PCOS belly” is a common name for the belly fat that tends to form around the midsection of PCOS patients. Fat tends to accumulate in this area due to increased androgens levels caused by PCOS.  Can PCOS be cured by losing weight?  No. There is no official cure for PCOS. However, losing weight can help you to better manage PCOS-related symptoms like acne, irregular cycles, and thinning hair. In fact, the National Health Service (NHS) in England estimates that just a 5% decrease in body weight can lead to significant improvements in PCOS-related symptoms.  Can PCOS go away naturally?  There is no research that suggests PCOS can go away naturally or on its own. However, even though there is no cure, it is still possible to manage some of the most frustrating symptoms. Doctors often advise lifestyle modifications as the first line of treatment. If that doesn’t work, medication may be appropriate.       Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

But what is the difference between IVF and IUI?    This article will help you get back to basics and understand the differences between IVF and IUI. The following information improve your chance of getting pregnant based on your unique fertility situation. The aim of this article is purely educational. Mira is not designed to monitor any fertility treatment. Please always refer to your healthcare provider. Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) Intrauterine insemination, or IUI, is a fertility procedure where concentrated motile sperm are inserted directly into a woman’s uterus. IUI may be performed with or without drugs used to stimulate ovarian reserves, including Clomid, Letrozole and Gonadotropin. For women under 38 years old, the chances of conceiving through IUI with no drugs are 1 to 5 percent. The chances of conceiving using Clomid or Letrozole are 4 to 9 percent, and the chances of conceiving using Gonadotropin are 8 to 10 percent. Unfortunately, IUI is not appropriate for all women facing infertility, including those with severely diminished ovarian reserve, two blocked fallopian tubes or a partner with an extreme case of male factor infertility. After three cycles, IUI also begins to lose its effectiveness, at which point IVF may be required to increase your chance of getting pregnant. IUI takes more time, has a higher chance of multiples per pregnancy and ends in more miscarriages than IVF; however, it is far less expensive and invasive than IVF, and so might be an appropriate first step for qualifying couples embarking on their fertility journey.    In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) In-vitro fertilization, or IVF, is a five-step process that consists of the following steps:  Pre-cycle diagnostic testing Stimulation of the ovaries Retrieval of the eggs from each ovary Fertilization of the eggs in a laboratory Transfer of resulting embryos into the uterus  The effectiveness of IVF depends on the causes of infertility as well as the woman’s age. The younger the woman, the higher her odds of conceiving through IVF. However, women who start IVF sooner tend to get pregnant sooner than those who try more cycles of IUI before switching to IVF. Compared with IUI, IVF has lower odds of miscarriage, lower rates of multiples per pregnancy and produces more embryos, as well as embryos that can be frozen. Still, some women may not want to go through IVF due to its inherently invasive nature. A full cycle of IVF requires more drugs than IUI, requires fertility monitoring and includes a minor surgical procedure (the retrieval of eggs from the ovaries). Unfortunately, IVF can cost as much as $20,000, which may be cost-prohibitive for many patients. Thankfully, there are grants available through many non-profit organizations that can help alleviate the cost of IVF. Hopefully, this article helps you to understand the difference between IUI and IVF. Both methods can be used as treatments for infertility, but deciding which is best for you is an inherently personal decision that should be made with your partner, your treatment team and your knowledge of infertility gained from Mira.

Where did the term come from? What does TTC mean for your pregnancy journey? Tips to help when TTC    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       So you’ve decided that you want to plan a pregnancy. How exciting!  A few Google searches later… and you might be finding yourself completely overwhelmed with all the fertility terminology floating around on message boards and social media. Reading acronyms like TTC, TTA, or FTM for the very first time is enough to make anyone’s head spin with confusion – and it may even feel like you’re learning a new language.  To help, we’d like to clear some things up for you on one of our favorite acronyms, TTC (trying to conceive). We’ll cover everything you need to know about what it means, how it relates to your fertility, and tips to consider for your pregnancy journey.  What does TTC mean? “TTC” is an acronym for the phrase “trying to conceive”, and it is one of the dozens of other fertility abbreviations found on social media and in online forums.  Individuals and couples who describe themselves as TTC are actively seeking to become pregnant, and they often utilize a variety of tools and techniques to optimize their chances of conception. Some of the most common techniques include tracking ovulation, planning intercourse around fertile days, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and in some cases utilizing assisted reproductive technology (ART).  Where did the term come from? While there is no clear answer on who exactly came up with the term “TTC” or how it came to be, there is evidence that it has been appearing in Google searches as early as 2005. In general, the origins of all fertility abbreviations are unknown. However, it is generally accepted that people began using them as shorthand in early online forums – and they’ve been around ever since!  What does TTC mean for your pregnancy journey? When trying to conceive (TTC), there are two elements to consider. The first element relates to fertility in general (i.e. the body’s natural ability to conceive) and the second element relates to the physical process of getting pregnant.  In order to maximize your chances of successful conception, it’s important that both elements are in balance. TTC and fertility A number of different factors can influence fertility while TTC. While many of these factors are within your control, others are not. One example of this is age, and it’s important to be aware that fertility begins to slowly decline at age 30 before rapidly declining after age 35. Other factors outside of your control that may impact fertility include medical conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis. Factors that are within your control that positively influence fertility revolve around your lifestyle.  This includes things like weight, diet, stress, and the use of potentially harmful substances such as tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and caffeine.  To learn more about how your lifestyle influences your chances of getting pregnant, check out our article Lifestyle Factors that can Impact Your Fertility.  TTC and pregnancy When it comes to actually getting pregnant, you might be surprised to learn that there’s a bit more to it than just simply having unprotected sex.  This is because there are technically only about six days during each cycle where it is physically possible for the body to conceive. This period of time is known as the fertile window, and it encompasses the five days before ovulation plus the day of ovulation. Couples TTC can conceive more efficiently by tracking this fertile window and planning sex accordingly.  There are several different strategies for estimating ovulation and the fertile window, with each strategy having its own pros and cons. While many methods can feel complicated or overwhelming at first, they do get easier with some practice.  To learn more about the fertile window and how to track it, check out our article When (and What) Is a Fertile Window? [TTC + TTA Planning].  Tips to help when TTC Track ovulation Tracking ovulation is key to getting pregnant as efficiently as possible. Why? Because it enables you to identify your fertile window, plan sex at the right time, and increase your chances of conceiving.  There are many different methods you can use to help track ovulation and the most fertile days of your cycle. The most common include:  Using the calendar method (also known as the rhythm method) Tracking cervical mucus and cervical positioning  Tracking basal body temperature   Another way to predict ovulation is by monitoring your hormone levels directly. This can be done with an at-home hormone tracking system like Mira, which can track your unique hormone levels throughout your cycle and let you know which days you are fertile and non-fertile.   Have intercourse every other day Once you’ve estimated your fertile window, it’s important to have regular intercourse with your partner during this time.  Exactly how regular is up to each couple, however, doctors often recommend having sex at least every other day. This is backed up by research that shows there is only a small difference in pregnancy rates for couples who have intercourse every other day during their fertile window versus couples who have sex every day. This fact may come as a relief to couples who feel like the prospect of having daily sex is overwhelming and unattainable.   Use prenatal vitamins It is also recommended to start taking prenatal vitamins at least one month before TTC. Prenatal vitamins often include key nutrients such as folic acid, calcium, iron, and vitamin D, which are essential for promoting cell growth and preventing birth defects.   At a bare minimum, the CDC recommends taking at least 400mcg (micrograms) of folic acid on a daily basis while TTC. This is because folic acid helps to prevent neural tube defects in fetal growth, which occurs during the initial 28 days after conception.  Maintain a healthy body weight It is well documented that individuals who are overweight or underweight can experience higher rates of infertility. This is because the number of fat cells in the body can influence reproductive system functioning, such as irregular periods, absent periods, and cycles that are either too long or too short. To keep your weight at a healthy level for conception, consider the following tips:  Make sure to eat three well-balanced meals each day with healthy snacking in between.  Incorporate foods that are rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats to help you stay fuller for longer. Avoid foods that are high in sugar and saturated fats.  Try to incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.  Avoid overtraining and allow your body to rest and recover after exercise.    Consider seeking help If you have been TTC for a while without any luck, know that you are not alone. The Office on Women’s Health estimates that around 10% of women in the United States struggle to get pregnant or stay pregnant.  As a rule of thumb, you should consider seeking additional help from your doctor or a fertility specialist if you:  Are under the age of 35 and haven’t gotten pregnant after 12 months of unprotected sex without using birth control.  Are over the age of 35 and haven’t gotten pregnant after 6 months of unprotected sex without using birth control.   For further information on finding a fertility specialist, check out our article 7 Steps to Help Choose the Right Fertility Provider for You.             Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

What color is your blood when you have a miscarriage? How do doctors test for miscarriage? In later pregnancies, the signs and symptoms of a miscarriage will be more evident. What happens in a chemical pregnancy? What happens if I am miscarrying? Conclusion    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      There are many things that can cause a woman’s period to vary each month depending on one’s lifestyle.  But if you’re someone that has menstrual periods regularly and can predict when it should arrive, it can be a bit alarming if your period starts later than normal.  Some women may find themselves wondering if their late period is actually a miscarriage(medically referred to as spontaneous abortion). Usually, miscarriage is defined as pregnancy loss before the 20th week. But there’s also loss during early pregnancy.  Early pregnancy loss is common in about 10% of pregnancies. In this situation, it’s possible to not be able to tell the difference between a heavy period or a miscarriage. If there was an instance of unprotected sex during your fertile period then pregnancy is very possible. Is it my period or miscarriage? In early pregnancy, it’s difficult to know whether or not you’re having a miscarriage or pregnancy because the symptoms are so similar in the beginning. Assess your symptoms and compare them to your previous periods.   Vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy loss can be pretty similar to your regular menstrual cycle. Take notice of whether or not you’re experiencing more heavy bleeding than normal.  Cramping is another symptom that you may experience during your period and miscarriage, during miscarriage your symptoms are usually much more painful and last longer.  Back pain in your upper and lower back can be a sign of miscarriage as well.  Blood clots can accompany heavy bleeding, you may notice small pieces of tissue in the toilet or when you wipe.  What color is your blood when you have a miscarriage? You may see blood that ranges from pink to red to brown, similar to what you may see during your regular period. Red blood is fresh blood that you will usually see in the beginning. Brown blood is older blood that has been in the uterus a while.  How do doctors test for miscarriage? If it’s possible you’re having a miscarriage, your doctor will perform a few tests to figure out exactly what’s going on. A few of the test a doctor may perform include:   Blood test: Your doctor may choose to perform a blood test to determine whether pregnancy hormones are being produced. Your doctor may also check for any indication of infections as well.  Pelvic Exam: A pelvic exam may also be done to look for any possible indication of a miscarriage as well. Your healthcare provider may take a look at your cervix to see if there are any changes.  Ultrasound: An ultrasound may also be performed to check for any indication of pregnancy as well. However, If there’s a possibility you’re in early pregnancy it’s hard to determine whether or not you will see anything.  Pregnancy test:  With pregnancy test detecting lower and lower levels of the pregnancy hormones it’s possible even during early pregnancy to receive a positive test.  In later pregnancies, the signs and symptoms of a miscarriage will be more evident. If you’re aware that you’re pregnant and begin to have a miscarriage you may notice that your pregnancy symptoms such as morning sickness, sore nipples, vomiting, and other symptoms you were once having disappear. Many women report a feeling of no longer feeling as though they’re pregnant. Other signs and symptoms you’ll experience in later miscarriages include:  Heavy Bleeding Severe cramping Severe abdominal/belly pain Dull pain in your lower back, this can feel like pressure as well. Changes in vaginal discharge  If you know you’re pregnant and you begin to experience any of the symptoms above, it’s important to contact your healthcare provider to decide the next step should be for your care. If you’re pregnant and you’re experiencing the symptoms mentioned above along with severe pain in your pelvis and shoulder pain it’s important you contact your doctor immediately. It’s possible you may be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, which can be extremely life-threatening. An ectopic pregnancy is when a pregnancy occurs outside of the uterus usually in your fallopian tube. If this happens and the pregnancy continues to progress, your tube may rupture causing a lot of internal bleeding that could require surgery.  It’s important to know this type of pregnancy cannot move to your uterus so treatment is always required. What happens in a chemical pregnancy? A chemical pregnancy is a known pregnancy followed by bleeding shortly after. Pregnancy may have been confirmed by a pregnancy test or bloodwork. Chemical pregnancies usually happen a couple of days after expected period, which is why it appears to be a late period or may appear to have been a false positive for most women. Most of the time chemical pregnancy signs and symptoms are like those of a regular period because it is such an early pregnancy loss. You can continue track your ovulation and trying to conceive after chemical pregnancy. Having a hard time tracking ovulation?

If your healthcare provider determines you are miscarrying your signs and symptoms will determine the type of treatment needed for you. Typically a woman’s body will naturally begin to miscarry the pregnancy and begin the process of ending the pregnancy. However, sometimes other treatments may be needed. If there’s still pregnancy tissue left and bleeding continues, you may need a procedure performed called Dilation and Curettage(D&C). This commonly performed procedure widens the cervix and allows the uterine wall to be scraped. If this procedure is decided, talk with your healthcare provider about what you may expect and how to keep you comfortable. Sometimes medication may be given instead of the procedure mentioned above to cause your body to end the pregnancy as well. Your healthcare provider can help you decide what is best for you.  Why does miscarriage happen? The first thing to know if you’re experiencing or have experienced a miscarriage is that it’s not your fault. In most cases, chromosome abnormalities are the cause of many first trimester miscarriages. In this case, there’s nothing you can do differently to stop a miscarriage from happening. Are there things that can put me at risk of miscarriage? It’s important to always lead a life as healthy as possible before conception. Smoking and alcohol use during known pregnancy can increase your risk of miscarriage. Consuming a lot of caffeine can also increase your chances of miscarrying, so it’s important to drink caffeine in moderation if you’re pregnant. Avoiding alcohol and tobacco along with controlling your caffeine intake can help with achieving a healthy pregnancy. How do I cope with having a miscarriage? No matter how far along you may have been, the loss of a pregnancy can be painful for you and your partner. It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider for guidance. Finding a local support group or a support group online can help with some of your feelings. Conclusion During early pregnancy, especially if you’re not sure that you’re pregnant, it can be difficult to determine whether or not you’ve had a miscarriage or if its a regular period. Keeping up with your cycles, fertile days, and sexual activity can help you determine whether or not you’re experiencing a heavier than a normal period or an early miscarriage. If you find that you’re experiencing a miscarriage, it’s important to know that you’re not alone. It’s okay to feel sad, lost or even confused during this experience. It’s also important to seek help if needed.

It’s a question that has been mentioned but rarely explored. While society often associates pregnancy with cisgender women, it’s important to recognize that transgender men who retain their uterus and ovaries can conceive and carry a pregnancy.  For example, Thomas Beatie, who gained significant media attention in 2008 as the world’s first legally recognized pregnant transgender man, is a prime example that challenges societal norms. He had undergone hormone therapy but retained his female reproductive organs, became pregnant, and gave birth to three children. Educating and raising awareness about transgender pregnancies is crucial to dispel myths, challenge preconceptions, and foster inclusivity. Limited research and societal attitudes can also impact the experiences of transgender parents. By shedding light on these issues, we can advocate for change and support in the transgender community. In this article, we’ll explore the complexities of transgender pregnancy and parenting—and highlight the experiences of transgender men’s journeys to parenthood. The aim of this article is purely educational. Mira is not designed to monitor any fertility treatment. Please always refer to your healthcare provider. How Do Transgender Men Get Pregnant? Is It Possible? To understand the possibility of transgender men getting pregnant, we must recognize that not all men have the same anatomy. People assigned female at birth who later transition to male may retain their uterus and ovaries. In such cases, transgender men can conceive and carry a pregnancy. But, it’s important to note that each individual’s fertility journey is unique, and not all transgender men will have the ability or desire to conceive. To ensure a private and convenient journey, it significantly helps TTC individuals to incorporate a highly effective fertility hormone-tracking system. Please note: while there are no studies yet on how at-home urine hormone trackers work for trans men, Mira is actively looking into it and will share results when available.     Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Can a Man Get Pregnant Without a Uterus? For transgender men who have undergone surgical removal of the uterus or have a medical condition preventing pregnancy, carrying a pregnancy naturally may not be possible. However, thanks to medical science, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) offer alternative pathways to parenthood. Medical Transitioning & its Impact on Fertility Transitioning through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) plays a significant role in the lives of transgender individuals. Testosterone is commonly used for masculinization, and it can affect fertility by suppressing ovulation and menstruation. This means that while on hormone therapy, transgender men are unlikely to conceive naturally. However, it’s essential to consult with healthcare providers specializing in transgender health to understand hormone therapy’s potential effects on fertility fully.            Ovulation and menstruation suppression occurs due to the hormonal changes induced by testosterone. As testosterone levels increase, ovulation is blocked, and the production of estrogen and progesterone decreases, disrupting the regular menstrual cycle. This effect is reversible to some extent. However, it’s not guaranteed, as it may take time for the reproductive system to regain its normal function. Physical Changes and Challenges Pregnancy brings physical changes that transgender men may face, similar to cisgender women. These changes can include weight gain, breast enlargement, and hormonal fluctuations. Adjusting to these changes can be emotionally challenging, particularly for those managing dysphoria. Providing support, understanding, and access to healthcare professionals knowledgeable about transgender health can help transgender men navigate these challenges and meet their unique needs during pregnancy. Fertility Preservation Options Before Transitioning For transgender individuals who desire biological parenthood in the future, standard fertility preservation options, such as egg freezing, are available. This procedure allows them to have a biological connection to their future children. Pregnancy Possibilities for Transgender Men To achieve pregnancy, transgender men may need to temporarily cease hormone therapy to allow for natural ovulation and conception. Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), or the use of a gestational surrogate, can be utilized to facilitate conception. Exploring the Emotional Journey The emotional journey of pregnancy for transgender men can be a bit complex. Navigating societal perceptions, managing dysphoria, and building a support network are essential aspects of the process. Mental and emotional preparation and counseling are vital in providing guidance and care during pregnancy. Building a solid support network, including healthcare providers knowledgeable about transgender experiences, helps transgender men receive inclusive and affirming care throughout their pregnancy. Legal and Social Considerations for Transgender Pregnancies Transgender pregnancies can present legal and social challenges that transgender parents may need to navigate. Understanding the legal frameworks and parental rights is crucial to ensure the protection and recognition of transgender parents and their families in ways such as:   Navigating legal frameworks: Transgender parents face legal complexities regarding their parental rights, such as recognition and custody. Seek legal guidance for understanding rights and options.   Establishing parental rights: Ensure legal recognition, custody, and decision-making for transgender parents. Advocate for inclusive legal frameworks to protect their rights.   Addressing discrimination: Challenge societal discrimination and stigma, and promote awareness for an inclusive environment. Advocate for policies safeguarding transgender parents’ rights.   Building support systems: Establish strong support networks with family, friends, and community organizations. Create safe spaces and tailored support groups for transgender parents. Please note: If you need resources to access or build support groups, visit www.familyequality.org.   Comprehensive Prenatal Care Finding transgender-friendly healthcare providers is essential to ensure comprehensive prenatal care. Addressing the unique healthcare needs of transgender men during pregnancy, including hormone management, incorporating healthy TTC habits, and mental health support, is crucial. Access to knowledgeable and supportive healthcare professionals can help transgender individuals navigate the physical and emotional changes during pregnancy.

Lesbian pregnancies FAQs    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      In modern parenthood, traditional norms are being challenged and redefined. For same-sex parents, particularly lesbian couples, the journey to parenthood is not just about adoption or surrogacy anymore. Technological advancements in fertility solutions and reproductive medicine have opened up a world of possibilities.    But what if we told you that one child could have two biological moms? This article will explore this fascinating possibility and delve into the innovative technologies transforming the landscape of LGBT parenting. Overview of same-sex parenting rights and statistics As we dive into the modern world of same-sex parenting, it’s essential to acknowledge the changing landscape of rights and recognition for same-sex parents. As of 2023, same-sex marriage is recognized in over 30 countries worldwide—a significant step forward for LGBT parenting rights. However, the struggle for acceptance and legal security continues.It’s estimated that nearly 114,000 same-sex couples are raising children in the United States. These families are increasingly visible, diverse, and changing the face of society. The demographics of LGBT parents are also shifting, with more and more young people in the LGBT community expressing a desire to become parents. Can one child have two biological moms? Traditional conception requires an egg from a woman and sperm from a man. But recent scientific advancements have made it possible for a child to have two biological moms. Let’s delve into the existing technologies and those on the horizon that could redefine the biological possibilities of lesbian parenthood.        Existing technologies Reciprocal IVF Reciprocal IVF allows both partners in a lesbian couple to be physically involved in the conception of their baby. One partner provides the egg, fertilized in a lab (in-vitro) with donor sperm. The resulting embryo is then implanted in the other partner, who carries the pregnancy. This way, one mom is genetically connected to the baby, and the other has the unique bond of being the gestational mom.  The aim of this article is purely educational. Mira is not designed to monitor any fertility treatment. Please always refer to your healthcare provider. Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) IUI is the most straightforward method and involves inseminating the woman who will carry the baby with donor sperm. This procedure is typically performed in a fertility clinic. It can be coordinated with the woman’s natural cycle or with fertility medications to increase the chance of pregnancy. Technologies of the future INVOcell INVOcell is a relatively new procedure that uses a small, plastic device inserted into the woman’s body to allow for natural fertilization and early embryo development. It could be used with Reciprocal IVF, providing a less expensive and more natural method of IVF for same-sex couples. Stem cell technology Scientists are currently researching using stem cells to create sperm and eggs. For instance, they’ve already transformed stem cells into early-stage eggs and sperm. If this line of research proceeds successfully, in the future, it could be possible to create an egg and sperm from two women. This would allow both women to be biological parents of their children.     Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Lesbian pregnancies FAQs What is the definition of same-sex parenting?  Same-sex parenting refers to parenting one or more children by two people of the same sex. How do same-sex parents handle gender roles in parenting?  Just like heterosexual parents, same-sex parents share the responsibilities of parenting based on their strengths, interests, and schedules rather than adhering to traditional gender roles. What support networks are available for same-sex parents?  Many LGBT organizations provide resources and support for same-sex parents. This may include counseling, social events, and assistance in navigating legal and social challenges.  The future of same-sex parenting is exciting and promising. As science continues to push boundaries and redefine possibilities, lesbian couples have more opportunities than ever to create a family that is biologically their own. Despite societal, legal, and financial hurdles, the path to parenthood for same-sex couples is becoming more accessible, and their families are gaining increased recognition and acceptance.

It’s not just about location and pricing, it’s also important to find a clinic that is excited to help LGBTQ+ couples just as much as they are heterosexual couples or singletons.  To help, here’s a closer look at why it’s so important to find an LGBT-friendly fertility clinic, what to consider when evaluating your options, and how to get the most out of your fertility journey. We’ve also included a list of the most popular LGBT-friendly clinics in the United States. Importance of finding an LGBT-friendly fertility clinic Whether you are utilizing a surrogate or undergoing a procedure such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF), the fertility clinic you work with as an LGBTQ+ couple matters. Why? Because it’s important to feel comfortable, accepted, and safe throughout the entire fertility process. Growing your family is stressful enough, and an unprofessional and negative experience with a clinic will only add to this stress. Not only that, but it can potentially negatively impact a pregnancy for those undergoing fertility treatments.  You may think that a clinic could never be anything but supportive of LGBT+ couples, however, we know first-hand that negative experiences do happen.  In fact, in our recent LGBTQ & Fertility Survey, 1 out of every 2 respondents admitted that their medical provider made offensive comments towards them or their partners due to their identity or sexual orientation.   This is simply not okay, and it should never happen to any couple looking to start or grow their family. That’s why it is so important to take time to plan ahead, explore all of your options, and choose a fertility clinic that is the very best option for your family.         5 Factors to Consider When Choosing an LGBT-friendly fertility clinic Website and language A good old-fashioned google search will be your friend when exploring your options for an LGBT-friendly fertility clinic. Once you find a clinic in your area, the very first thing you should do is check that there is a dedicated LGBTQ+ section on their website. This is common and should be relatively easy to find from the main navigation bar. Many websites even have a rainbow flag icon at the top of their website that will take you directly to their resources and services for LGBTQ+ couples.  If a page like this doesn’t exist, this could be a red flag. However, we recognize that options may be limited in your area, so it doesn’t hurt to call and ask about the clinic’s experience with LGBTQ+ couples. If the conversation makes you feel uncomfortable, you can go ahead and cross this clinic off your list and keep looking.  Ratings and reputation within the LGBTQ+ community Some clinics have a more established reputation among the LGBTQ+ community. You may hear about them within your own network of friends, or, you may learn about them online. If you do happen to know of a widely popular and well-reputed LGBT-friendly clinic in your area, it’s a good idea to explore this clinic first to see if it is a good fit for your family.  Other clinics may claim to be LGBT-friendly, however, it can be hard to get a feel for what the culture at the clinic is really like. This is where ratings on places like Google or Trustpilot can be helpful – bearing in mind to always take extreme reviews with a grain of salt.  Another tool that may be helpful is the SART search engine tool, which only displays SART member clinics that meet high standards for assisted reproductive services. Again, never be afraid to call a clinic to get a feel for how friendly they are to LGBTQ+ couples.  Certifications and success rates It should go without saying, but all clinics under consideration should follow proper lab practices and only use board-certified medical professionals. It’s also important to be aware of what the clinic’s success rates are. For example, the average success rate for IVF is around 75%. With this figure in mind, try to look for a clinic with success rates at or above average.  Additional support Growing a family as an LGBTQ+ couple comes with its own unique set of challenges, and many fertility clinics offer additional support that you may be interested in exploring.  For example, some may be able to recommend legal experts who can help you get the appropriate paperwork in place. Others may be able to connect you with a reputable cryobank that they regularly work with. It’s also common to see clinics provide additional support for mental and emotional health throughout the fertility treatment process.  If any of these additional services are important to you, make sure to ask about them in your initial consultations with fertility clinics on your radar.  Location and timing Depending on where you live, your fertility clinic options may be limited. However, it’s important to prioritize a clinic that is LGBT-friendly over one that is not – even if that means having to travel a bit further. This is something that you should discuss together with your partner ahead of time so that you are both on the same page when evaluating clinics.  In some cases, an LGBT-friendly clinic may be close to your home and easy to access, however, you may be put on a waiting list. Although this can be frustrating, it’s important to remember that choosing the right clinic for the long-term is more important than choosing a clinic that is more convenient in the short-term.  Top 10 LGBT-Friendly Clinics in the US Please note that Mira is not affiliated with any of the clinics mentioned below.

It Gave Me a Peace of Mind and Taught Me Things About My Body”   Kate B          This describes a Mira customer’s personal experience and/or was sourced from a review or interview. Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor. Having been on birth control for over a decade, 29-year-old Kate B. was worried that her menstrual cycle would not be regular when she stopped taking birth control. She was also concerned that her history with an eating disorder would contribute to the irregularity of her menstrual cycle and thus hinder her ability to conceive. Read on to learn more about how Mira’s products eased Kate B.’s anxiety and helped her and her partner get pregnant in just two months.   Confused and discouraged by traditional testing methods When Kate B. had stopped taking birth control, her menstrual cycle was regular for two months. However, she soon found out that this was only because of the active hormones that remained in her system. Following the two months, she was not having a regular cycle at all.  Kate B. turned to treatment options such as acupuncture in hopes that it would help to regulate her cycle. While the acupuncture did help her eventually get her cycle back, it lasted 36 to 38 days.  This was a source of confusion and distraught for Kate B. because she was at the same time using over-the-counter ovulation strips to track and detect when she was ovulating. She had expected that the test strips would tell her when she would most likely conceive so that her and her partner could try for a baby. Unfortunately, the traditional test kits provided inaccurate information that left her discouraged. For one, Kate B. could never tell if there was a second line. Furthermore, because her cycle was long, Kate B. was not ovulating around day 14, which she had initially expected. Over time, Kate B. and her partner were mentally and physically exhausted from the frequent testing and guessing. They were convinced that she was somehow not ovulating.  A chance encounter with Mira Just when she was on the verge of giving up, Kate B. saw a post online about Mira’s products and was impressed by the reviews that were left by other women who were trying to conceive and successfully did so with aid from Mira’s products. Initially, Kate B. was hesitant to give Mira a try because it was priced slightly higher than typical fertility products. She also did not want to be left disappointed like traditional ovulation test kits had left her. However, when she saw that Mira’s products were covered by HSA (Health Savings Account), she immediately placed her order and waited patiently for her parcel to arrive at her doors.  Learning about her body with Mira Kate B. loved that unlike other fertility products, Mira took the guesswork out of whether or not she was ovulating. Mira was able to pinpoint exactly when she was ovulating. She found that whereas fertility strips were hard to read and interpret, Mira provided actual numbers and detailed information that were easy to understand. She loved that Mira’s products told her exactly what was going on and left no room for misinterpretation.  Kate B. was particularly impressed that Mira was able to shed light on things that were happening to her within her body. It provided her with a lot of information about her body that she never knew about. For example, Kate B. learned that she only started ovulating after day 22. If she had stuck to traditional testing methods, Kate B. would have given up and stopped testing after day 18.  The Mira Fertility System also reflected spikes in estrogen levels, which helped Kate B. anticipate when she was about to ovulate. All in all, The Mira Fertility System took all the guesswork—and stress—out of tracking her cycle. It allowed Kate B. to get a peace of mind that she was in fact, “normal” and that all she had to do was to try to conceive a lot later than most couples do.  Life after Mira With Mira, Kate B. was able to identify and pinpoint when she was ovulating. The useful information helped the couple to get pregnant just two months after. Thrilled to have found Mira on her pregnancy journey, Kate B. told everyone she knew about Mira.  She also feels that it would help if couples could find a community that would help them feel better and less alone.  “I found a lot of comfort in Mira’s social media posts and resources because I felt that I was not alone in facing these fertility issues. This vulnerable topic is not something that people talk about too often and I was thrilled to have found a community of people there.”   “After trying for so long, the trying to conceive journey could so easily be turned into just another task on your to-do list. You want to bring a child into this world out of love. So, it’s important to remain patient in the process and be kind to your body—something that many women fail to do!” Finally, Kate B. wanted to let others know that this journey could be a tough one and it would help if women out there who are trying to conceive would turn their frustration and confusion into kindness and love for their partner.     Recent Stories Irregular cycles      Trending Topics Irregular Cycles Relationship Meditation OPK Weight Gain Ebook Covid-19 Infections Fertility Nutrition Alternative solutions Stories LH Natural Fertility Planning Miscarriage hCG Male Fertility Trying to Avoid Natural Family Planning FSH Cramps & Pain fertility supplements Fertility Fertity AMH Mira Partnerships TSH Prolactin Fertility Coaching Hormone Coaching Mira App Tips Early Pregnancy Symptoms (DPO) BBT Postpartum Unexplained Infertility Discharge Quiz TWW Workouts Luteal Phase Mental Health Checklist Fertility Tea Lifestyle Ovulation Tracking Comparison Supplements Sex Pregnancy Test Period Planning for pregnancy Trying to Conceive LGBTQ Ovulation Cycles Tracking Progesterone Estrogen Pregnancy Hormones PCOS Early Access Bleeding & Spotting Endometriosis Fertility Treatments Inclusivity Hormone Imbalances Data Safety Complications Birth Control Research Women's Health Hormone Tracking Hormones Tracking Mira Fertility Monitor 35+ TTC Trouble Conceiving Symptoms Perimenopause Menopause   Free TTC Book                              Download “The Ultimate Guide To Fertility”                                                              Send me the eBook                                          Your fertility journey starts now Understand the full scope of your cycle, trends, and actual hormone concentrations.

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor. 36-year-old Loren is seven months pregnant as of July 2021. Her trying to conceive journey, like many, is filled with many ups and downs. But through it all, her determination and support from her loved ones did not wane. Read on to learn more about Loren’s trying to conceive story and how she got pregnant on her first month of using Mira’s products.  Difficulties and challenges Loren and her partner were both in their mid to late thirties when they had decided to try for a baby. Although the couple did not face any obvious or jarring problems, they knew deep down that it may a take a little longer than they had hoped for.  In addition to their age being a factor, Loren had mild Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)— a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts. As a result, her menstrual cycles, although regular, tended to be on the lengthier side.  With all these in mind, Loren and her partner anticipated that their trying to conceive journey may be longer and more challenging than they would like it to be.  Negative experience with other fertility products Because of her experience with mild PCOS, accurately predicting ovulation time was quite tricky for Loren. That’s because for her, ovulation did not fall in line with the standard “day 14” rule that people often read about online. She experienced this first hand when she got her hands on traditional fertility products like the fertility bracelet. After trying it for 10 whole months, Loren felt that it was inaccurate and unhelpful.  She also began to use a fertility monitor to track and monitor her core temperature after three months of trying to conceive. In addition, she used digital ovulation tests every month. All of these methods proved wildly expensive but ineffective, leaving her discouraged and stress out.  Through it all, Loren went regular check in appointments with her gynaecologist with regular scans and blood tests to make sure everything was alright. She even took a considerable amount of pre-pregnancy vitamins. The couple had also started to research In vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in case they needed further assessment. Finding support and discovering Mira When fertility products and fertility doctors were unable to help her achieve her pregnancy goals, Loren found the greatest support in her husband. She also found a lot of information online about how other couples are experiencing their trying to conceive journey. While she was online, Loren also conducted extensive research. Through her thorough research, Loren came across Mira. However, after her frustration and negative experience with ovulation sticks and other tech gadgets that weren’t working, she remained sceptical despite being ready to give it a try.   Loren’s experience with Mira Loren loved that Mira’s products work differently from other ovulation tracking apps on the market by adding a concentration value to her individual hormone surge. Mira was able to pinpoint exactly when she was ovulating. She found that whereas fertility strips were hard to read and interpret, Mira provided actual numbers and detailed information that were easy to understand. She loved that Mira’s products told her exactly what was going on and left no room for misinterpretation. “As someone who likes data and numbers, this felt a much more accurate way to record over temperature which is subject to many factors or OPKs that measure against a standard baseline. In fact, my Mira curve looked wildly different to others which just shows the importance of personalisation in fertility tracking.”      Life after Mira With Mira, Loren was able to identify and pinpoint when she was ovulating. The useful information helped the couple to get pregnant just one month after. In fact, Loren got pregnant even before she had the chance to use her second box of Mira.  “Well, I got pregnant on my first month using Mira which may be a coincidence but I like to think not! In fact, Mira accurately predicted a hormone surge at a much earlier time than other methods had predicted for ovulation and I only just managed to catch the tail end of peak fertility. I was sure I had missed my window and felt very down in my two week wait, however, I was stunned to find out I was pregnant! I am positive this is down to Mira detecting that hormone surge and adding a clear numerical value to it. I didn’t even get to use my second box of Mira plus wands that are still sitting in my bathroom.”  For those out there who are trying… Excited to share her review and experience with Mira with other women out there who are trying to conceive, Loren wanted to let others know that it is perfectly fine to make use of technology during your trying to conceive journey. “Whilst you may think you know your body inside out, don’t be afraid to use a little help from technology to back that up because you may be surprised.

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor.    After years of trying, with no success, and heartbreaking miscarriages, Yvonne and her husband were blessed with a healthy daughter. Read on to learn more about Yvonne’s TTC (trying to conceive) story and how she was able to get pregnant three times within three years using Mira’s products. Heartache and loss Yvonne and her husband had been trying to conceive for five years with no success. They were convinced it was never going to happen but in 2018 they decided to make their health a priority to increase their chances and it worked! Yvonne fell pregnant quickly, so she knew it could happen, but her hopes were dashed when she suffered a miscarriage at 9 weeks. They knew they wanted to try again, but after years of trying and the heartache of loss, they needed to eliminate the guesswork. Yvonne began tracking her cycle and with Mira guiding their efforts, she was pregnant again after only 6 months. They were over the moon! The first trimester passed like a dream, and they were ecstatic. Unfortunately at 19 weeks misfortune struck again. Yvonne’s water broke spontaneously and she was forced to deliver her baby girl knowing she would never make it. Their world was turned upside down and they were heartbroken and confused.  After taking some time off to process everything, they were ready to try again. With Mira’s help, Yvonne and her husband were able to conceive a baby boy this time. Doctor’s suspected Yvonne had an incompetent cervix, but other than keeping a watchful eye on everything, there wasn’t much they could do. At 16 weeks her cervix was starting to funnel open and the all too familiar pain and heartbreak of pregnancy loss loomed large.  Specialist intervention proved unsuccessful and once again, Yvonne had to deliver her son, knowing he would not make it either. Her son was born a week before Christmas and the loss was devastating.        Complications and diagnosis To make matters worse, Yvonne’s father was diagnosed with a devastating cancer diagnosis during this time. It felt like heartache was all around as she tried to heal emotionally and physically from her loss, while also trying to be there for her father. Adding insult to injury, doctor’s discovered a sizable cyst that required one of Yvonne’s ovaries to be surgically removed. She was sure she’d never be able to conceive again, even though doctors told her otherwise. The losses were starting to add up and the couple needed time to process everything that had happened. They took a long break from trying, knowing Mira would be there to help them when they were ready again.        A happy ending When they were finally ready, Mira was there to guide them and before long Yvonne was pregnant again. After what had happened with her last two pregnancies, the doctor’s had a plan this time. Yvonne was diagnosed with an incompetent cervix, or cervical insufficiency – weak cervical tissue that contributes to premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy. It can be hard to diagnose, but Yvonne’s previous pregnancy experiences all but confirmed it. The fix? This time doctor’s put in what’s known as a cervical cerclage which is a procedure to close the cervix with strong sutures so it doesn’t open too soon and cause you to give birth too early.   Although the pregnancy was stressful and high risk, the fix worked and held the pregnancy.  Unfortunately Yvonne lost her father to colon cancer during this time adding to the stress, but at the end of it all she got her miracle and was blessed with a happy healthy daughter.  How Mira helped In the end, their journey was far from smooth. Loss and heartache seemed to just keep coming and it was a tumultuous time in their lives. Yvonne felt like she was suffering so much emotionally and physically, that anything to make the journey easier was worth it. And that’s where using Mira really came into play. It was straightforward and easy to use, and gave Yvonne some control over something that felt ultimately beyond her control. It took some of the frustration out of trying to conceive.   She loved how easy it was to use and that it only took minutes out of her day. Not only that, but It gave so much insight that she was finally able to eliminate the guesswork when it came to her cycle and conceived 3 times using the device. Mira’s scientific approach and concrete numbers were exactly what they needed and in the end it helped Yvonne finally get her miracle baby.              Recent Stories After miscarriage      Trending Topics Irregular Cycles Relationship Meditation OPK Weight Gain Ebook Covid-19 Infections Fertility Nutrition Alternative solutions Stories LH Natural Fertility Planning Miscarriage hCG Male Fertility Trying to Avoid Natural Family Planning FSH Cramps & Pain fertility supplements Fertility Fertity AMH Mira Partnerships TSH Prolactin Fertility Coaching Hormone Coaching Mira App Tips Early Pregnancy Symptoms (DPO) BBT Postpartum Unexplained Infertility Discharge Quiz TWW Workouts Luteal Phase Mental Health Checklist Fertility Tea Lifestyle Ovulation Tracking Comparison Supplements Sex Pregnancy Test Period Planning for pregnancy Trying to Conceive LGBTQ Ovulation Cycles Tracking Progesterone Estrogen Pregnancy Hormones PCOS Early Access Bleeding & Spotting Endometriosis Fertility Treatments Inclusivity Hormone Imbalances Data Safety Complications Birth Control Research Women's Health Hormone Tracking Hormones Tracking Mira Fertility Monitor 35+ TTC Trouble Conceiving Symptoms Perimenopause Menopause   Free TTC Book                              Download “The Ultimate Guide To Fertility”                                                              Send me the eBook                                          Your fertility journey starts now Understand the full scope of your cycle, trends, and actual hormone concentrations.

The American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists states, approximately 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies will end in miscarriage. It’s certainly a good idea to learn more about the causes and symptoms, as well as how to cope with it.  The Most Common Causes of Miscarriage After an early pregnancy loss, oftentimes women place the fault on themselves or their lifestyle, but in the majority of cases, there is nothing that could’ve been done to prevent it. Common myths of the causes of miscarriage are exercise, sex or a daily cup of a caffeinated beverage. 1. Chromosomal Abnormalities When both the sperm and egg meet during fertilization, each of them brings 23 chromosomes together to create 23 matched pairs of chromosomes. Minor chromosome abnormalities can stop the embryo from growing, resulting in a spontaneous abortion (more on getting pregnant after an abortion here). As women age, it may result in these incompatibilities and miscarriages occurring more often. According to the American Pregnancy Association, the most common cause of miscarriage stems from a genetic abnormality in the embryo. 2. Hormone imbalances 15 percent of miscarriages are the result of unbalanced hormones. For instance, deficient levels of progesterone can prevent a fertilized egg from being implanted into the uterus. The LH hormone is a key part of the ovulation process. The LH your body produces is responsible for triggering ovulation. A tracking device like Mira Fertility tracker can help understand your personal hormone patterns for a precise ovulation window, which is helpful for those trying to conceive again.      3. Abnormal Growth in the Uterine Abnormal growths of certain areas in the uterine can disrupt blood flow to the fetus. Some women are born with a septum, an excess uterine tissue that can be related to miscarriages. Some women have bands of scar tissue in their uterus from previous surgeries and second-trimester abortions, which can cause a blood clot to the fetal tissue. Fortunately, most uterine issues can be treated by a doctor using specialized X-Rays, and/or a dilation and curettage procedure. 4. High-Temperature Fever Regardless of your healthiness, developing a high fever with a body temperature of over 102 degrees Fahrenheit, during early pregnancy, can increase the risk of a miscarriage. The most crucial stage of stable body temperature is before 6 weeks of pregnancy. Symptoms of a miscarriage  1. Bleeding and Cramping Vaginal bleeding and cramping are the most common symptoms of miscarriage. During the first trimester, light bleeding or spotting is common and is not a definite sign of a miscarriage. There can also be growing pains nearing the end of the first trimester as your ligaments stretch and get accustomed to pregnancy. Bleeding can vary from light spots to heavy bleeding that can be more than a normal period. Sometimes the amount of blood loss can be overwhelming, yet it’s completely natural. Cramping pains can either happen alongside the bleeding or come on its own. The cramping pains can range from mild to severe. Cramping pains can be described as a dull ache, sharp cramps, or an aching back. 2. Lack, or Complete Loss of Pregnancy-Related Symptoms Some women may feel that they’re simply not pregnant anymore into their cycle. Typical symptoms like tender breasts or sickness may simply disappear. It’s also normal for some women to have no symptoms at all of a miscarriage. This type of miscarriage is called a missed miscarriage. 3. Vaginal Discharge Having an increase in vaginal discharge while pregnant is common. A healthy discharge looks thin, clear or egg white. Signs of infection:  Foul smell Discoloration: green, brown or yellow Vagina feels itchy and sore Pain when urinating  4. Ectopic Pregnancy Miscarriages can result from a pregnancy developing outside of the womb. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. This can be a serious issue because of the higher risk of internal bleeding. Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy:  Consistent abdominal pain on one side of the body.  Vaginal bleeding that is dark and watery Pain in the shoulder tips Fainting and lightheadedness Excess vomiting and diarrhea  Ectopic pregnancy symptoms usually happen between week 5 and week 14 of pregnancy. You can also have negative urine-based pregnancy tests even though these symptoms are still present. Coping with a Miscarriage  Allow yourself to express your emotions, miscarriage is like losing a loved one, you can expect to experience a wide range of strong emotions. Finding a solid support system can help you recover physically and emotionally, which can help you prepare for trying to conceive your next time around. 1. Reach Out to Family and Friends The grieving process can be an exhausting one. Reach out for emotional support from family and friends to help with household chores and childcare if need be. Also, opening up about your emotions regarding the situation can help expedite the healing process. 2. Find an Online Support Group Many people have miscarriages, even though it is not often spoken about in public, and is often a taboo subject. While your support network can be there for you, it can prove helpful to connect with others who have experienced the same exact loss you had. 3. Speak with a Therapist There are therapists and counselors that specialize in grief counseling to help you recover and overcome emotional issues. You can also go to couples counseling as well to help you and your partner get on the same page about the pregnancy process.

How does an abortion impact ovulation? How does an abortion impact fertility? Tips for getting pregnant after an abortion    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      Despite the numerouus myths you may hear floating around, it is absolutely possible to become pregnant following an abortion. But how soon after having an abortion is it actually safe to get pregnant again?    To help answer this question, we will be taking a look at how an abortion can impact ovulation and fertility, how soon after an abortion you can get pregnant, and tips for getting pregnant safely and efficiently after you’ve had an abortion. Can you get pregnant after abortion? Yes. You can get pregnant after having an abortion. This is true for both surgical and medical abortions. If you have recently had an abortion and would like to prevent future pregnancies, know that you can still get pregnant immediately following the procedure. Therefore, it’s important to make sure to use protection the next time you have sex. If you have had an abortion recently but still want to conceive sometime in the future, know that an abortion will not impact your chances of having a normal pregnancy at another point in your life. How does an abortion impact ovulation? Abortions do not typically have any impact on ovulation or fertility. It’s important to bear in mind that prior to an abortion, ovulation will have stopped due to pregnancy. However, after an abortion, your body will restart its menstrual cycle. This means that you can expect to ovulate and have your period in the weeks following an abortion. How soon do you ovulate after an abortion? There is no standard amount of time that you can expect to ovulate after an abortion.  Everyone’s body is different, and some menstrual cycles can last only 21 days while others last as long as 40 days.           Assuming that your cycle begins the day after your abortion, you can expect ovulation to occur within the next 2-3 weeks. One study found that on average, ovulation returned approximately 3 weeks following a medical abortion with the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol. If you are further along in your pregnancy and require a surgical abortion (sometimes called an “in-clinic” abortion), it may take a few weeks longer to ovulate. This is because pregnancy hormones may remain in your body for a few weeks following your procedure and prolong the start of your menstrual cycle. When does your menstrual cycle return to normal after an abortion? Your menstrual cycle should resume immediately following an abortion. However, everyone’s body is different, and while some women may have a period again in the next four weeks, it may take others 8-12 weeks for their menstrual cycle to return back to normal. If you have not had a period after 8-12 weeks following an abortion, speak with your doctor and they can provide further advice and guidance. How does an abortion impact fertility? Whether you have had an abortion recently or sometime in your past, you may be concerned about its potential impact on your fertility and ability to get pregnant again. To ease any concerns you may have, here are a few of the most common questions regarding abortion and fertility answered. How does an abortion impact future pregnancies? Having a safe and legal abortion should not have any negative impact on your fertility prospects for the future. This is backed up by medical research and includes your ability to get pregnant, your ability to maintain a healthy pregnancy to full term, and your ability to give birth. However, in rare cases, there is a risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in the event that an infection spreads throughout your womb, uterine tubes, and ovaries in the aftermath of your procedure. If you do develop PID, this can increase your future risk of infertility or having an ectopic pregnancy. To prevent PID from developing after an abortion, make sure to:  Only receive a medical or surgical abortion from a legal, medical provider Never attempt a self-induced abortion Be aware of the early signs and symptoms of PID (severe pelvic pain, fever, painful urination, yellow/green discharge, and foul-smelling discharge) Call your doctor immediately if you are experiencing any of these symptoms  If you are having a surgical abortion, your doctor will likely already prescribe you a round of antibiotics to prevent infection from happening in the first place. However, it’s still important to be aware of the potential warning signs and symptoms of infection after abortion to reduce your risk of developing PID. How soon after an abortion can you get pregnant? Because your cycle can resume immediately following an abortion, it is possible to become pregnant straight away. If you ovulate within 2-3 weeks, this means that you can technically become pregnant within a month after having an abortion. However, bear in mind that everyone’s bodies and timeliness are different, so the earliest you can get pregnant after an abortion can vary among women. If you want to prevent further pregnancies, you should begin taking birth control immediately following an abortion. What are your chances of getting pregnant after an abortion? Unless you have had a complication, abortion does not impact your chances of getting pregnant in the future. This means that you are not more or less likely to get pregnant in the future if you have had an abortion. Are there any risks associated with getting pregnant after an abortion? The risks associated with getting pregnant after an abortion are minimal and can depend on the type of abortion you had. For medical abortions (the type of abortion where you must take oral medication either at home or at a doctor’s office), the risk of having complications with future pregnancies is very low. This means that your chances of experiencing complications like giving birth prematurely, giving birth to a low-weight baby, having an ectopic pregnancy, and losing your pregnancy are all low. For surgical abortions (the type of abortion where a tool is used to remove the fetus via the vagina), the risk of future pregnancy complications is slightly higher. One study found that women who underwent a “dilation and evacuation” procedure (often referred to as “D&E”), may be at an increased risk of having a premature delivery with a low birth weight baby. To avoid complications associated with surgical abortions, doctors often recommend that patients have an abortion as early in their pregnancy as possible so that they can have a medical abortion. Tips for getting pregnant after an abortion No matter when you had an abortion, it is completely normal to want to get pregnant at a different time in your life. Here are a few practical tips for navigating pregnancy post-abortion. Give your body time to heal Having an abortion can take both a physical and emotional toll on your body. That’s why it’s so important to make sure that your body and mind have had sufficient time to recover in the aftermath of an abortion. This is not only best for your health, but it is critical to the health and safety of your future pregnancy. In terms of your body, it is a good idea to wait until your menstrual cycle has been regular for at least a few months before trying to get pregnant after having an abortion. Additionally, due to hormonal fluctuations, you may experience increased feelings of fatigue and irritability, difficulties with sleeping, and in some cases feelings of anxiety and depression – all of which can impede your efforts to get pregnant. If you do find yourself struggling to cope with your emotions following an abortion, it is a good idea to prioritize your mental health by seeking help from a counselor, taking time off work, or joining a support group. Once you feel like you are physically and emotionally “ready” to get pregnant, you may also find it comforting to have a conversation with your doctor before trying to conceive again with your partner. Make sure you’re ovulating regularly The most efficient way to get pregnant is by tracking ovulation and planning sex accordingly. This is especially true if you have recently had an abortion, due to the fact that it may take a few weeks or months for your cycle and ovulation patterns to return to normal. There are several ways that you can monitor ovulation over time in order to get to know your cycle better. A few of the most common methods include:  The Calendar Method – where you simply track the dates of your period over time in order to calculate your day of ovulation (this can take up to a year of continuous tracking to accurately understand your cycle). The Basal Body Temperature Method – where you take your temperature at the same time each morning in order to detect the 0.5°F increase in temperature that typically happens 12 hours after ovulation. Ovulation Predictor Kits – where you take an at-home test that is similar to a pregnancy test, but instead of testing for the pregnancy hormone hCG, it tests for luteinizing hormone (LH) which surges right before ovulation. Comprehensive Hormone Tracking – where you use a hormone tracking system like Mira to accurately monitor your individual cycle and predict ovulation.  It may take some time to figure out the best method for you. However, with a bit of patience, you will be able to better understand the patterns of your cycle and successfully plan a pregnancy following an abortion. Plan your attempts carefully Once you get the hang of tracking your cycle and predicting ovulation, you should then be aware of when you are the most “fertile” so that you can plan sex with your partner at the right times.  On average, there are only about six days during your cycle where you can get pregnant. These six days are what doctors often refer to as your “fertile window”, and it starts around five days prior to ovulation and ends the day after ovulation. To maximize your chances of conceiving, you should aim to have sex with your partner as much as possible during this window of time.

Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      Getting pregnant doesn’t happen magically. Even if you and your partner are both fertile, you still only have a 25% chance of getting pregnant each cycle. Conception is a dance between your fertility hormones and your partner’s — and if you aren’t paying attention to the data, it could take months or even years to figure out what’s not working.  Hormones control everything in our bodies from our appetites to our moods to our fertility but nowhere do they shine more than during pregnancy.  Pregnancy hormones turn your body into a baby maker and control everything from how the fetus grows to changes in your muscles. There are eight major pregnancy hormones at play when trying to conceive:  Estrogen Progesterone luteinizing hormone (LH) follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) Relaxin Oxytocin Prolactin.  Much of what is happening to your body during pregnancy can be pinned on these hormones and in this post we will go over what each hormone is, what it does during pregnancy, and how your hormones change over the course of a successful pregnancy. Pregnancy Hormones Estrogen What is estrogen? Estrogen is a primary sex hormone found in women’s bodies that helps regulate the menstrual cycle, fertility, and overall health.  Estrogen is produced by the follicles and corpus luteum after ovulation. Healthy estrogen levels are essential for an ovulatory menstrual cycle and estrogen plays a key role in many functions throughout the body.  It plays a role in bone formation, cholesterol levels, and the development of secondary female sex characteristics like breasts and pubic hair, not to mention cardiovascular functions and mood management. Estrogen is also responsible for building up the lining of your uterus every month and helps regulate the flow and thickness of uterine mucus secretions. It’s also responsible for the formation of breast tissue and stopping the flow of milk after weaning. What does estrogen do during pregnancy? During pregnancy, estrogen helps the uterus grow, aids in fetal development and maintains the uterine lining.  Estrogen also helps regulate other key hormones and increases blood flow, making it responsible for that pregnancy “glow” you might experience.  It also promotes the growth of breast tissue and the flow of milk for breastfeeding. Progesterone What is progesterone? The pregnancy hormone progesterone is essential for fully-functioning fallopian tubes, a healthy period, and ensures you are able to get and stay pregnant until full term. On top of that, all other female fertility hormones are made from progesterone. That makes it a pretty important hormone to track for your fertility and overall health! Sometimes called the pregnancy hormone, progesterone works on many fronts. From preparing your body for pregnancy to its role in your libido, progesterone primarily supports your body in getting pregnant and maintaining that pregnancy. Secreted by the corpus luteum, progesterone is mainly produced in the ovaries. The corpus luteum, a temporary gland formed in the ovaries after ovulation, is made from a follicle that housed a maturing egg and forms as soon as the egg pops out. A small amount of progesterone is produced by the adrenal glands that sit atop the kidneys, and once pregnant, production takes place in the placenta. What does progesterone do during pregnancy? Progesterone primarily supports your body in maintaining a pregnancy (more details here).  It does this through thickening the uterine lining to welcome a fertilized egg and maintaining that lining throughout pregnancy. Progesterone works on the smooth muscles and prevents uterine contractions so the uterus doesn’t reject the fetus.  It also helps prime the glands involved in breastfeeding to get your breasts ready to start making milk. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) What is luteinizing hormone? LH is produced in the anterior pituitary gland and is responsible for triggering ovulation and the development of the corpus luteum in the ovary. During ovulation, LH levels surge and send a signal to the ovary that it’s time to release an egg.  LH works on the follicle to burst and free up the egg for fertilization. What does LH do during pregnancy? LH’s main role is in ovulation and it doesn’t play much of a role in pregnancy.  Once the follicle has burst, cells proliferate and it becomes the corpus luteum, producing progesterone.  Early on in pregnancy, your brain shifts from producing hormones that support ovulation to those that maintain pregnancy so LH is no longer needed.  LH levels typically drop and stay low across pregnancy. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) What is follicle stimulating hormone? As the name suggests, follicle stimulating hormone triggers the ovaries to make eggs and estrogen by stimulating the follicles.  Like LH, FSH is produced by the anterior pituitary gland in the brain and helps control your monthly cycle. They work together to tell follicles in the ovaries to begin maturing. It’s important for your ovaries to release an egg when you ovulate because only eggs can be fertilized. FSH also affects the levels of estrogen that then has an impact on your cervical mucus, one of the telltale signs you’re within your fertile window. Most of the time, your cervical mucus will be thick, white or off-white, and creamy. When you are ovulating, however, your cervical mucus becomes stretchy and clear, like the consistency of an egg white, to help sperm survive and reach an egg. FSH is responsible for this important change. What does FSH do during pregnancy? If an embryo has implanted in the uterine wall, FSH levels begin to drop and stay low for the duration of the pregnancy.  Because your cycle is temporarily paused while pregnant, FSH levels are naturally low during this time. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HcG) What is human chorionic gonadotropin? Also known as hCG or beta hCG and released mainly during pregnancy, this is the pregnancy hormone that home pregnancy tests detect and measure in your urine to determine a positive result.  As early pregnancy progresses, hCG levels typically follow a predictable pattern of increasing, but that may not always be the case. Although it is produced naturally in the body and you may find trace amounts in your system at other times, hCG is really only produced once an embryo implants in the uterus. What does hCG do during pregnancy? hCG is produced by the cells surrounding a developing embryo that eventually go on to form the placenta.  Production of this hormone kicks in almost immediately after implantation and levels double every 72 hours during the early weeks of pregnancy. After implantation happens and hCG starts to be produced, it ensures the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone throughout the first trimester of pregnancy.  Without progesterone, the womb lining would shed and prevent an embryo from implanting.  hCG makes sure this doesn’t happen by ensuring the corpus luteum continues progesterone production until the placenta is established and can take over production. In addition to how it triggers progesterone production and supports fetal growth, hCG also supports other bodily functions over the course of a pregnancy. It promotes the development of new blood vessels in the uterus as well as smoothing the muscle cells in the uterine wall, both critical developments for maintaining a pregnancy.  The main function of hCG though is to trigger the corpus luteum to continue progesterone production and prevent the embryo from being rejected due to immunological reasons. Relaxin What is relaxin? Relaxin is the hormone known for its role in facilitating childbirth (although research suggests it may play a role in the development of the endometrium as well).  It is also produced by the corpus luteum after ovulation in order to help promote implantation of the embryo.      This pregnancy hormone is primarily involved in the loosening of ligaments, muscles, and joints to facilitate a growing body and childbirth.  Most importantly, as the fetus grows, it allows the uterus to expand by signaling the uterine ligaments to loosen up. What does relaxin do during pregnancy? Levels of this hormone steadily increase as pregnancy progresses.  Relaxin plays a starring role in childbirth as it works on the ligaments and joints to loosen up and creates space for them to expand during birth.  It also works on the cervix by softening and lengthening it in preparation for labor. Oxytocin What is oxytocin? Produced by the hypothalamus and secreted by the pituitary gland, this pregnancy hormone plays a crucial role in labor and breastfeeding.  It stimulates the uterine muscles to contract so labor begins and the baby is pushed out.  It also increases relaxation, lowers stress and anxiety, and plays a role in bonding. What does oxytocin do during pregnancy? Levels of this hormone gradually increase during pregnancy and then have a sharp increase during labor and delivery.  This makes sense given its role in stimulating contractions but oxytocin also helps move the baby down and out of the birth canal and limits bleeding at the site of the placenta.  After delivery oxytocin helps shrink the uterus in size and aid in milk production. Prolactin What is prolactin? Named for its role in lactation, this hormone promotes breast milk production as well as a variety of other functions in the body.  Prolactin is produced in the pituitary gland as well as the uterus, immune cells, brain, breasts, and fat tissue.  Production is partially controlled by estrogen and it is released in high levels when a newborn baby suckles at their mother’s breast.  Levels rise significantly during pregnancy to prepare your breasts for breastfeeding. What does prolactin do during pregnancy? Given its role in breastfeeding, prolactin prepares your breasts to begin milk production.  It helps make breast milk and levels may increase by 10 to 20 times during pregnancy.  During pregnancy its main job is to help enlarge your breasts and kickstart the milk production you’ll need to feed your baby. When do pregnancy hormones start? Hormones are always sending information in our bodies but pregnancy hormones follow a set and predictable schedule during healthy pregnancies. First trimester During the first trimester, progesterone, estrogen, and hCG play a starring role.  Because hCG is the hormone that indicates pregnancy, this is often the first pregnancy hormone really at work, and is even responsible for a positive result on a home pregnancy test.  Levels of these hormones rise rapidly during the first trimester and you may begin to experience symptoms you’ve never experienced before. Second trimester During the second trimester you’ll start to see increases of relaxin as your body needs to accommodate a growing uterus and fetus.  You may start to notice new sensations (or pain) in your muscles and joints as relaxin works its magic to loosen your body up for childbirth.  Estrogen and progesterone will continue to rise as progesterone dominates throughout the pregnancy.  Third trimester Your third trimester will continue to see rising estrogen levels until they peak at around 32 weeks with progesterone.  Prolactin production will increase to get the body ready for lactation and is almost ten times higher at the end of pregnancy than at the beginning.  Oxytocin will significantly increase to prepare for labor and is helpful with feelings of bonding and motherhood after birth. Many other hormones are involved in pregnancy and each has a role to play.  Even though they may seem all over the place, these pregnancy hormones work together on your behalf over the course of a successful pregnancy.

By combining LH             (luteinizing hormone) and E3G readings, you pinpoint your full fertile window and ovulation. E3G and LH are             related to IVF, menopause, and hormone imbalances such as PCOS. By tracking them, you’re getting more out of             your hormone tracking—you’re getting full reproductive health insights.

Medical advisor and partner at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG                      “The Mira Fertility Tracker offers excellent quality and accurate results at the patient's fingertips.                 As a health provider, I find that Mira’s quantitative measures far outweigh most qualitative                 over-the-counter kits. Mira is far more useful in clinical applications. We utilize Mira with our                 patients to help them successfully monitor, track and succeed in achieving pregnancies.”                  Meir Olcha, MD. Medical advisor and partner at Mira.

FACOG.                      ““As a fertility specialist, I was used to seeing my patients’ hormone results only twice per cycle.                 With Mira, I can see hormone patterns throughout many days of the cycle, over multiple months. This has                 provided clinical insight I have never had access to before, and allows me to tailor treatments in a                 much more individualized way. This personalized approach has helped patients become pregnant at                 significantly higher rates than standard, traditional, and generic fertility protocols.”                  Erin Foran Wolff, MD Partner at Mira.

""From my perspective as a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, Mira is a game-changing                 tool for patients and clinicians. With the convenience of home urine testing, the quantitative data of a                 laboratory blood test, and an informative and engaging app for hormone tracking—it seems to be the best                 of all worlds to improve the patient experience and optimize treatment outcomes. We are actively                 pursuing approaches to incorporate Mira into fertility treatments to reduce the burden of unnecessary                 blood tests and clinic visits.”                  Gary S.

Yes! With Mira, you can see your actual hormone concentrations. As long as you ovulate, you will be able                 to know when you ovulate—even with irregular cycles.                                    How does Mira work for people with PCOS? Which kit is best for PCOS?                                  Mira is very PCOS-friendly and many women with PCOS prefer it to track their cycles. Unlike traditional                 OPKs, Mira provides you with actual hormone concentration values. With PCOS elevated LH is usually                 common - this means OPKs can give you a false positive all the time.Mira doesn’t use a pre-determined                 average, so you can see your actual hormone levels and curve even if your baseline LH is high (such as                 with PCOS) if you have multiple LH peaks, or irregular ovulation.                                 If you have PCOS, we recommend you to try the                 Mira Super Bundle.                      I'm trying to get pregnant. How can Mira help me?                      People trying to conceive don’t always know when their most fertile days are. Researchers found that                 only 12.7% of people with ovaries know when they ovulate correctly, and only 55% estimated their                 ovulation within their fertile window. Mira tracks key fertility hormones concentrations to give you                 personalized insights and maximizes your chances of conceiving.                      When will Mira Monitor be shipped?                      On average, US, UK, and AU orders will arrive in 3-6 business days. Other countries may take longer.                 Sometimes, the shipping time may take a little longer due to high demand. Please refer to the time on                 the checkout page.

Signs of missed miscarriage What causes a missed miscarriage? How are missed miscarriages diagnosed What happens next if you’re TTC?    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      Early pregnancy is a time of excitement and hope, but it can also be one of anxiety and worry.  If you have had a difficult time conceiving or have experienced pregnancy losses previously it can be a stressful time as well.  Miscarriage, or pregnancy loss, is when the baby stops developing in the womb and is usually accompanied by tell tale signs such as heavy bleeding with clots and lower abdominal pain.  But did you know you can have a miscarriage without bleeding or any of the other usual signs? This type of miscarriage is known as a silent or missed miscarriage and like the name implies, can come as a complete surprise since it often occurs unnoticed.  So what is a missed miscarriage?  In this post we will cover the signs, symptoms and causes of missed miscarriages as well as what happens after one has occurred. What is a missed (or silent) miscarrriage? A missed miscarriage is when the fetus has stopped developing but has also not been physically expelled by the body.  In other words, a missed miscarriage is when the baby has stopped developing in the womb but the body has not yet recognized the loss of pregnancy and the pregnancy tissues (fetus and placenta) have not been physically miscarried.  The placenta may continue to release hormones so the woman may still experience signs of pregnancy. Also known as a silent miscarriage or missed abortion, a missed miscarriage often occurs without obvious symptoms like bleeding or pain.  Because there has been no sign that anything was wrong, the news of a silent miscarriage can come as a complete shock to women and is often diagnosed during a routine ultrasound scan. Signs of missed miscarriage Unfortunately this type of miscarriage can be difficult to suspect or diagnose given that there are usually no physical symptoms associated with it.  You may have had minor spotting, but even that can be absent and is a perfectly common sign of early pregnancy.  Just as the name suggests, a silent miscarriage doesn’t usually cause the typical symptoms of bleeding and cramping that occur in other miscarriages or those symptoms might be missed. While it is common to not have the more well-known symptoms of a miscarriage, you may notice subtle signs including:  Fewer feelings of nausea Decreased fatigue Decreased breast tenderness Small amount of brownish or red vaginal discharge   Simply “not feeling pregnant” or a loss of pregnancy symptoms alone are not a cause for concern or signs of a missed miscarriage though, since they can also occur in typical pregnancies.  With a silent miscarriage, there is often no way you could know you are experiencing a miscarriage with no symptoms except by having a routine pregnancy scan. What causes a missed miscarriage? Doctors don’t know for sure what causes missed miscarriages and there’s usually no clear explanation for why they happen.  There are several common explanations that may give some clues, but each case is different and in most cases there is nothing you could have done to affect the outcome. A pregnancy loss can be caused by a number of factors including physical trauma, chromosomal abnormalities, or infections. Or, you may experience a blighted ovum which is when an embryo implants in the uterus but doesn’t develop into a baby.  Since chromosomal abnormalities can hinder the growth of a fetus, they are a common cause of missed miscarriages.  These abnormalities are random in nature and it’s not possible to detect them prior to a missed miscarriage. How common is a missed miscarriage? Miscarriage, when the baby stops developing in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy, occurs in 8-15% of clinically recognized pregnancies and in 30% of all pregnancies.  Most occur within the first trimester or before the 12th week of pregnancy, with a small percentage taking place between 13-19 weeks. So how common are they?  Unfortunately, we don’t have an exact number or know how frequently they occur because many happen before a woman even knows she’s pregnant.  One study estimated that almost 3% of recognized pregnancies end in missed miscarriages and are often discovered at first trimester ultrasounds. Close to 50-75% of pregnancy losses that occur are known as a chemical pregnancy.  This type of loss occurs when a pregnancy ends shortly after implantation and before the fetus can be detected by ultrasound.  Much like silent miscarriages, the woman may not even know she was pregnant and the minimum bleeding might be mistaken as an expected period. When do they usually occur? Silent miscarriages occur early in a pregnancy and are officially defined as a pregnancy loss that occurs before 20 weeks of gestation without showing any signs of it.  They are most often discovered at a routine first trimester scan between 11-14 weeks and most women won’t be aware of a silent miscarriage until their doctor detects it during an ultrasound. Of all pregnancies, approximately 3% of them will result in a missed miscarriage.  An early ultrasound can show that fetal development, or lack thereof, was not viable before the actual onset of common symptoms such as bleeding and cramping. How are missed miscarriages diagnosed Most women who experience a silent miscarriage head into their early pregnancy scan with no idea that anything is wrong. A missed miscarriage is typically diagnosed when a routine ultrasound or early pregnancy scan shows no fetal heartbeat or an embryo that appears too small for the progression of the pregnancy. Sometimes it is too early in the pregnancy to see a heartbeat at a scan, especially for women with longer cycles or when the timing is unknown.  Your doctor will usually monitor you with the help of bloodwork (which can include hCG and progesterone level testing) and a follow-up scan to definitively diagnose that the pregnancy has stopped progressing and confirm a miscarriage. Once a miscarriage has been confirmed your health care provider will discuss your best options for treatment. There are several treatments for removing the embryonic tissue from the body and ensuring you don’t experience other complications such as infection. Treatment options might include:  Expectant management – if there are no infection complications, you can wait for the body to pass the embryonic tissue on its own Medical management – take a medication that will trigger your body to pass the tissue Surgical management – Dilation and curettage (D&C) surgery may be required if your body doesn’t pass the tissue on its own or medication doesn’t work  Your health care provider will be able to work with you on the best treatment option and help manage your recovery. Physically it can take weeks or a few months (usually around 3) to recover and return to your normal cycle. Emotional recovery can take longer and allowing yourself the time to work through your loss is important. Finding the right emotional support is a key part of your recovery. What happens next if you’re TTC? While it can take weeks to months for your body to physically recover from a miscarriage, most women get their period again four to six weeks after one has occurred.  You can start trying to conceive in the first cycle after a pregnancy loss or after your period has returned.   You should discuss with your doctor whether you are physically cleared to start trying again or you should hold off.  Of course if you are undergoing more testing or further scans to try and find out more about why you miscarried, you may need to wait before you try to get pregnant again.  Emotionally recovering from a miscarriage can take longer and will be largely dependent on the individual and the support methods available to them.  Diagnosis can be shocking, especially if you had no signs of a missed miscarriage and you may have strong feelings as you come to grips with the news.  Whether you suspected something was wrong or not, this can be a very stressful time where you are faced with making difficult decisions. If you experience a loss of a pregnancy know that you aren’t alone and there are resources for support in this difficult time. Your doctor should be able to provide information on assistance and resources to address your emotional well-being.  Some women find it helpful to talk with others or seek support through their partner or miscarriage support organizations. The following resources may help you navigate a miscarriage diagnosis:   Share Pregnancy & Infant Loss Support – resources for families with pregnancy or infant loss  Compassionate Friends – resources for families after the death of a child  Centering – Grief resources for all ages  The March of Dimes – resources for grieving parents  M.E.N.D. Organization – resources for families with infant loss  Pregnancy loss is a unique experience for every person and allowing yourself to recover is part of your physical and emotional journey.  Miscarriage can be hard to handle and many women suffer in silence.  It’s normal to experience a wide range of emotions and important to mentally and emotionally process your experience.  There is no right timeline and everyone processes loss differently.  If you find yourself struggling, talk to your doctor for additional guidance or to refer you to counselling.  However difficult silent miscarriage might be, most women go on to have healthy pregnancies after an early pregnancy loss.         Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Choosing the right multivitamins Vitamins that help ovulation General fertility vitamins for women Conclusion    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         When it comes to getting pregnant it can feel like it’s out of your control, but there are things you can do to help out the cause.  Lifestyle choices are a major factor in improving fertility and vitamins and supplements are one area you can certainly take charge.  Not only will they prepare your body for pregnancy, but the right combination of supplements and vitamins could even boost your chances of conceiving.  We’ve researched the best fertility supplements to get pregnant to help you figure out that combination.  Pregnancy doesn’t happen without ovulation though so we’ve also looked at vitamins to help ovulation.  After all, one of the best ways to get female fertility help and optimize your chances of getting pregnant is to make sure your body has the building blocks it needs.  In this article we’ll cover what each supplement does, the best vitamins to support ovulation, and how they can give your fertility a boost.    Can Supplements Boost Fertility? Diet and lifestyle are major factors when it comes to your fertility and how successful you will be at getting pregnant. There are many things you can do to boost fertility, like quitting smoking for example, but research has shown that getting the right micronutrients can also influence fertility.  After all, your body needs these nutrients to support physiological processes like ovulation, fertilization, and implantation so it makes sense that having adequate levels would have a beneficial effect on fertility.   Traditionally supplementation has focused on its many benefits for preventing birth defects and eating a healthy diet is still the best way to get the nutrients and minerals you need.  Although we need bigger and better studies on supplementation, early literature suggests proper supplementation can have a “small but beneficial” effect on fertility, including an increased chance at becoming pregnant and taking less time to do so.  It never hurts to take a broad-spectrum multivitamin, but when it comes to fertility you may want a more personalized approach to optimize results. Choosing the right multivitamins Choosing a prenatal multivitamin formulated by experts offers several distinct advantages, highlighting the premium quality of vitamins and emphasizing that not all supplements are created equal.  Formulas developed by experts, like the Mira Prenatals ones, typically contain an optimal balance and dosage of vitamins and minerals specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of pregnant women. These formulations are backed by scientific research and clinical expertise, ensuring that essential nutrients are provided in the most effective and bioavailable forms. Also, premium prenatal multivitamins sourced and selected by experts are more likely to use high-quality ingredients that undergo rigorous testing for purity, potency, and safety.  Vitamins that help ovulation Strictly speaking, the best way to help ovulation is to balance your hormones, maintain a healthy diet, get plenty of sleep, minimize stress levels, and exercise regularly.  This will increase your odds of ovulation, but there are certain supplements and vitamins that may also help.  Folates, omega-3 fatty acids, and iron have all been associated with ovulatory function. Folic acid is well known as an essential prenatal vitamin as it helps to reduce risk of neural tube defects.  But if you’re trying to get pregnant, it’s a good idea to supplement with this B vitamin for other reasons as well.  Although more research is needed, folic acid can potentially help with ovulation. And since many pregnancies are unplanned, or at the very least unexpected, supplementing before you are pregnant helps reduce unnecessary risk of neural tube defects and many healthcare providers suggest it as a crucial vitamin for all women.   Omega-3 fatty acids are good for many aspects of your overall health but in terms of fertility, they can especially help ovulation.  An important aspect of ovulation is having balanced hormones and omega-3’s have been shown to help regulate reproductive hormones. By reducing overall inflammation, omega-3s are a powerful supplement for female fertility help.  Not only that, some research shows that women who take omega-3’s are 1.5 times more likely to conceive than those that aren’t taking them.  With a host of other benefits, supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids can easily be one of the best fertility supplements to help you get pregnant.     Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Iron is a vital nutrient and impacts your energy as well as fertility.  There is a link between iron levels and ovulation since low levels may lead to a lack of ovulation, not to mention the energy level you’ll need to actually get pregnant.  But more research is needed on whether supplementing with iron is necessary to help avoid ovulatory issues.  Before rushing out to get an iron supplement, it’s best to have your levels checked by your doctor so they can determine if you are low or could use help via supplementation.  You’ll need more iron once you become pregnant to help prevent anemia, but unless you are having issues, you may not necessarily need it to become pregnant.  That’s why you should have your levels checked so your doctor can determine if you need the boost or not.              General fertility vitamins for women Vitamins are essential for many functions and play an important role in your health.  And when you’re trying to create the right environment for a pregnancy, it’s important that you are getting the right ones at the right levels.  The ones listed below are not only beneficial for your overall health, but have a promising role in the ability to get and stay pregnant.   Vitamin E Vitamin E helps repair cells and is a key nutrient for the ovaries.  It’s an essential fat-soluble nutrient and can be found in many foods and supplements and as an antioxidant it helps prevent damage to cells caused by free radicals.  Aside from the benefits it provides to the female reproductive system, it’s also found in many male fertility supplements.  Vitamin E enhances the efficiency of the male system by promoting sperm function and can be helpful for both men and women to take when trying to get pregnant.   Vitamin D Not only is vitamin D important for your overall health, but it may also be critical for fertility and pregnancy outcomes.  It’s crucial to your endocrine system and also helps regulate the absorption of calcium.  Getting enough vitamin D may lower inflammation, improve insulin resistance, and regulate your menstrual cycle.  It’s also one of the best fertility supplements for PCOS, a leading underlying cause of infertility.      Fish Oil Fish oil has a host of health benefits for women including brain and eye development, as well as preventing heart disease and declining mental function.  Research has also demonstrated that supplementing with fish oil can help improve ovulation, ovarian reserve, and overall fertility.  Fish oil is packed with omega-3s that all cells need to function normally and can be a vital source of fat and energy for the body.  Since our bodies don’t naturally produce omega-3s, they must be consumed through diet or supplementation. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) CoQ10 is known as a “mitochondrial nutrient” as it supports the mitochondria also known as the powerhouse of the cell.  This makes it critical to cellular energy production and can help improve egg quality.  Although it’s used for both cell growth and maintenance, it also has antioxidant properties.  Natural levels decline as we age and it’s difficult to consume enough via diet which makes this an important supplement to consider, especially if age is a factor. Since natural fertility levels decline as we age, this supplement is key if you are older or have low ovarian reserve. Consider screening your AMH level to check your ovarian reserve (you can even do it with an at-home lab test).     Expand your view into your hormones Test your 5 most important fertility biomarkers & get 5 personalized reports. Try Now    Selenium Selenium is another antioxidant that helps protect cells from the damage done by free radicals.  Research shows a preliminary link between a deficiency in selenium and miscarriage as well as it’s role in promoting healthy follicles in the ovaries.     N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) Another powerful antioxidant, n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) promotes detoxification and can protect eggs from oxidative damage.  It also helps increase the quality of cervical mucus which is important for helping sperm get where they need to go and keeping them in an optimal environment for survival.     Zinc Zinc plays a role in fertilization, DNA regulation, and embryo development.  Being deficient in this nutrient may have a negative effect on egg development as well as a host of other reproductive functions.  It also helps regulate hormone function and ovulation and is essential for proper functioning of the reproductive system.  Since our bodies can’t store zinc, it’s an important supplement for anyone trying to conceive.      Conclusion Boosting fertility can be a tricky business. Before deciding which supplement is right for you, it’s always best to consult with your physician. They can help you determine what nutrients you need and the best form for you to take them in, not to mention take into account your personal health variables and how supplementation may affect you.  Many factors can affect fertility but taking the best fertility supplements to get pregnant should always start with a conversation with your healthcare provider or a fertility coach.       Need fertility guidance from a pro? Book online consultation with our fertility coach. Schedule Now    In addition to using fertility supplements, it’s important to consider other things you can do to help you conceive. One of the best things you can do is use a fertility tracker that helps you make sense of your cycle.  It’s important to track your cycle and ovulation, especially if you plan to get pregnant at some point.  Digital fertility analyzers like Mira track actual hormone concentrations and use smart learning to better understand your specific cycle.  The hormone data alone can be extremely useful, regardless of your fertility goals.       Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Drinking and your body: what’s going on What else can affect a pregnancy test? Tips on testing correctly    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey          When taken correctly, pregnancy tests are estimated to be 99% accurate. While this means that they are incredibly reliable, it also means that there are certain factors that may impact their reliability.  In this article, we’ll be covering one of those factors… and that’s alcohol! Read on to learn all about how alcohol may indirectly affect the accuracy of a pregnancy test, why that is, and what’s going on in your body when you drink. We’ll also share a few practical tips for how to take a pregnancy test correctly in order to maximize your chances of receiving an accurate result.   Can alcohol affect a pregnancy test? Alcohol on its own does not directly affect the accuracy of a pregnancy test.  However, drinking too much alcohol can lead to dehydration which may indirectly affect a test’s accuracy if you are in the early days of pregnancy. This is because dehydration can lead to increased water consumption, which may dilute the amount of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in urine and cause a false-negative result.  Drinking and your body: what’s going on How drinking alcohol or excess fluids can affect pregnancy tests Before we dive into how alcohol can affect the accuracy of your pregnancy test, here’s a quick recap of how exactly pregnancy tests work.  Urine pregnancy tests are designed to detect the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (also known as hCG).  Everyone’s body produces hCG, with the normal “baseline” hCG level for non-pregnant individuals being less than 5 mIU/ml. For pregnant individuals, hCG levels are much higher (up to 100+ mIU/ml). In fact, from the moment implantation occurs, hCG levels rise rapidly and double every 2-3 days throughout the first month of pregnancy.  Once hCG levels are above the baseline level of 5 mIU/ml, they can be detected in a pregnancy test. Typically, hCG levels will be above 5 mIU/ml by 12 days past ovulation (DPO), however, individual cases and timings can vary.  Even though pregnancy tests are 99% accurate at detecting elevated hCG levels, they can still be affected by the amount of fluid in your system. Why? Because drinking lots of fluids can dilute your hCG levels and make them harder to detect. In turn, this may cause a pregnancy test to display a negative result even if you are in fact pregnant.  Can alcohol cause a false-positive pregnancy test?  Alcohol consumption is typically associated with false-negatives and not false-positives. This is because drinking alcohol often causes dehydration, leading to excess water consumption and the dilution of hCG in urine.  The most common causes of false-positive results include previous miscarriage, abortion, molar pregnancy, certain medications and/or medical conditions, and misusing/misinterpreting the test.  What if I accidentally drank before I knew I was pregnant? We all know that drinking alcohol is a big no-no while pregnant. However, if you drank alcohol before you even knew that you were pregnant – don’t panic. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agree that serious harm to your pregnancy is unlikely.  If you find yourself in this situation, the best thing you can do is to stop all alcohol consumption and make an appointment with your doctor or midwife. They can provide you with the best advice for your pregnancy.  If you are not currently pregnant but actively trying to conceive (TTC), it’s a good idea to just avoid alcohol altogether. This not only contributes to good fertility, but it will prevent any future pregnancies from exposure to alcohol-related risks.  To learn more about other lifestyle factors that may hinder the health of your pregnancy, check out our article Lifestyle Factors that can Impact Your Fertility.  What else can affect a pregnancy test? Can OTC and prescription drugs affect a pregnancy test? Commonly used over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs do not typically affect the accuracy of a pregnancy test.  However, certain infertility medications containing hCG may cause a false-positive result. Common medications that contain hCG include Pregnyl, Profasi, Novarel, and Ovidrel.  According to the independent medicine directory, Drugs.com, other medicines that may lead to a fast-positive result include antipsychotics, anti-seizure drugs, progestin-only birth control, anti-nausea drugs, sedatives, antihistamines, and anti-anxiety medications.   Can unhealthy habits impact a pregnancy test? While unhealthy habits like smoking, binge drinking, and over/undereating may make it more difficult to become pregnant, they do not necessarily directly impact the accuracy of a pregnancy test.  However, in some cases, these habits may indirectly affect the results. For example, consuming alcohol can make you dehydrated. We know that dehydration can lead to the overconsumption of water, which can cause hCG to be diluted in urine which increases your risk of receiving a false positive result. Another way that alcohol may lead to an inaccurate result is if a pregnancy test is taken incorrectly while under the influence of alcohol. Tips on testing correctly Know your cycle Pregnancy tests are 99% accurate when taken at the right point in your menstrual cycle. The earliest that you can take a pregnancy test is on the first day of your missed period. If your cycle lasts 28 days, this will be on 14 DPO, or 14 days past ovulation.  The best way to ensure that you know exactly where you are in your cycle is through cycle tracking. There are a number of different ways to do this – here are some of the most common methods you can use either on their own or in combination with each other:  Calendar/Calculator/Standard Days Method – involves the use of a basic formula to predict your day of ovulation, fertile window, and period. This can be done with a simple ovulation calculator like this or on the Mira App.  Basal Body Temperature (BBT) method – involves measuring your temperature each day with a BBT thermometer and tracking your results in a diary or an app. You can then monitor your individual trends to estimate key milestones throughout your cycle. Cervical Mucus Method – involves monitoring and tracking changes to your cervical mucus throughout your cycle. When monitored over time, you can estimate your period and fertile window.   Hormone Tracking – involves tracking your hormone levels directly in order to predict patterns in your cycle. This can be done with the help of ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) or more advanced hormone tracking systems like the Mira Max Starter Kit.   Remember – everyone’s cycle is different, with some cycles lasting as little as 21 days and others lasting as long as 40 days. The best way to know the right time to take a pregnancy test for your body is by keeping track of your own unique cycle patterns.  Test at the same time Urine concentration levels vary throughout the day as we consume water and other liquids. That’s why the best time to take a pregnancy test is first thing in the morning when your urine (and therefore hCG levels) are at their highest level of concentration. This will yield a stronger result line on your pregnancy test, making it easier to interpret your results.  Even though it might be tempting to test multiple times throughout the day, it’s best to only test at the exact same time each day (preferably in the morning when your urine contains the highest concentration levels of hCG). By only testing first-morning urine, you will be less likely to receive a false-negative result or a result that is difficult to interpret.   Don’t test too early The number one culprit behind false-negatives is testing too early. Remember, the very earliest that you can take a pregnancy test is on the first day of your missed period. However, even those who rigorously track their cycle may still be off in their estimations by a day or two.  If you are actively trying to conceive, try not to be discouraged by your first negative pregnancy test result – especially if it’s on the early side. The best thing you can do in this situation is to relax and find ways to distract yourself from obsessing about taking your next pregnancy test. You should then wait and take another test in a few days or even a week to make sure that you will receive the most accurate results. To learn more about the best time to take a pregnancy test, check out our article When to Take a Pregnancy Test Based on Science and Ovulation.

You can crave non-food items Unusual cravings to eat items that aren’t food is known as pica.  This can be more common in pregnancy because of the body’s increased nutritional needs.  If you aren’t eating the right foods or can’t eat due to nausea you may be more at risk to develop this condition.  And depending on what you eat, it can definitely harm your health.  Improving your nutritional intake can help but it’s always best to let your doctor know if you start to crave non-food items.  The uterus gets bigger This may not come as a surprise but as your pregnancy progresses your uterus gets bigger.  In fact, it can expand up to 500 times its regular size.  Before pregnancy your uterus is typically about the size of a large apple, but during pregnancy the uterus’ muscle fibers will lengthen to keep up and accommodate a growing baby and by the third trimester it may be as large as a watermelon.   A pregnant woman’s blood volume increases by up to 50% In order to supply the demands of oxygenated blood to a growing fetus, when pregnant your blood volume may increase by as much as 50%.  Blood flow to organs like the skin and kidneys also increases and the extra volume is needed to make up for it.  It can make walking up stairs or hills that much harder and research shows that physically active women often show greater increases than those that are less active.     Your sense of smell becomes stronger Thanks to an increase in hCG, the pregnancy hormone, your body undergoes a natural physiological response known as hyperosmia or heightened smell.  Although it doesn’t happen to everyone, it’s most common in the first trimester as hormones are rapidly increasing.  Smells you never even noticed before may become overwhelming and your once favorite smells might make you gag during this time.  Some smells more than others are common culprits but like all things, the level with which this affects you can vary greatly.   Your feet can grow bigger Hormones strike again but this time they can make your feet grow bigger.  The hormone relaxin helps soften and loosen ligaments and tissue for pregnancy, but since your feet are also packed with ligaments they can be affected as well.  The ligaments in your feet loosen and relax causing your feet to flatten and become wider.  For some this is a temporary phenomenon while for others their feet stay an increased size.   Babies can taste certain foods in the womb Sense of taste begins to develop as early as 8 weeks, when taste buds first appear and is the most developed sense by the time of birth.  Amniotic fluid is flavored by what you eat and since babies swallow amniotic fluid every day (between ¾ of a cup and 3 cups) they can taste what you’re eating.  Eating healthy not only supports pregnancy but food preferences are formed early and can even begin to develop in the womb.  Not only that, but some research shows that prenatal exposure to a variety of flavors can influence children’s willingness to try new foods so healthy eating can help in more ways than one.  Babies can cry in the womb Although you can’t hear them, it’s true that babies can cry in the womb.  Research has shown that babies are learning to react appropriately to negative stimuli and are basically practicing for the real thing.  This practice can include imitating breathing patterns of crying, facial expressions and even mouth movements.  It doesn’t last long and the vocal component of crying only develops after birth so there’s no real need to worry. Your skin really can glow Aside from the glow of being happy about your pregnancy, there are other medical reasons why your skin really can glow.  Hormone fluctuations, an increase in blood flow, and increased oil in the skin (thanks to those hormones) can all contribute to making your skin look flushed and give you that characteristic “pregnancy glow”.  It isn’t permanent and doesn’t happen to everyone, but you’re more likely to experience it during the height of bodily changes during the second trimester.   Hair can grow in new places With an influx of extra hormones you may notice your hair is thicker and fuller.  This is due to a change in the life cycle of the hair follicle as the hair stays in the growing phase longer.  Thanks to an increase in estrogen, you may also notice hair in new and unwanted places.  The face, belly, and nipples are common areas of unwanted hair growth but it’s not permanent and usually disappears after pregnancy. Cravings may mean your baby is deficient in certain nutrients Food cravings are extremely common in pregnancy but a growing number of people believe that this may be the body’s way to correct any nutrient deficiencies. There’s limited scientific evidence to support this theory, and your cravings may be caused by other factors like mood, lack of sleep, and poor hydration.  The best way to reduce cravings is to consume a healthy balanced diet and stay well hydrated, as well as identifying any triggers for certain foods.       Your voice can change during pregnancy Women’s voices are affected by hormones and certain times of the month or times of your life may change the pitch of your voice.  Although scientists have known this for decades, voice changes in pregnancy weren’t well studied.  New evidence confirms that women’s voices not only change during pregnancy but their pitch also lowers after birth.  The reasons for this may be complicated and include both physical factors like hormone fluctuations and psycho-social factors like how others perceive us based on the pitch of our voice, or how tired you may be with a newborn.       Babies can get startled in the womb Much like babies practice crying in the womb, they have shown that they can react to stimuli and get startled as well.  Babies are born with reflexes such as rooting, sucking, and grasping among others and the startle reflex is another normal part of reflex development.  It’s a normal response to stimulus and research shows that it starts to develop as early as 25 weeks.  It peaks in the first month of life and should be gone by 5 to 7 months of age.      Only 5% of babies are born on their due date Even though the centuries old method of calculating an estimated due date is the norm, it’s not necessarily accurate.  Only approximately 5% of babies are born on their due date meaning only about 5 in 100 people give birth on that magical estimated due date.  The truth is, it’s not unusual for babies to be born before or after their due date and it’s not an end date for your pregnancy.  Term pregnancies are anywhere between 37 to 42 weeks and estimated due dates are just that – an estimate of when your baby is likely to be born based on the date of your last menstrual period or an ultrasound. You’re actually not pregnant for 9 months The length of pregnancy, proposed by German obstetrician Franze Naegele, conveniently rounds out to approximately 40 weeks.  But like due dates, forty weeks is simply a convenient figure that has proven difficult to challenge.  A number of factors influence the length of your pregnancy and Naegele’s rule is only a guideline and not a definite date.  Even if you convert months into weeks or days, 9 months is only an average and not the norm for most women.  But accepted cultural norms can be hard to change and the exact date of fertilization may be unknown so this rule persists.     Babies can yawn in the womb It was well known that fetuses opened and closed their mouths in utero, but it wasn’t until it was specifically studied that scientists confirmed that babies do in fact yawn in the womb.  Surprisingly though, this isn’t from boredom or sleepiness.  Researchers believe that babies yawn as a response to brain development early in gestation and may be linked to neurological function.   Your heart grows bigger while pregnant As your blood volume increases, the heart must work harder to pump all that extra volume.  A variety of changes occur with the heart and cardiovascular system that are all completely normal.  Since the organs need more blood during pregnancy, blood flow increases and the heart compensates with volume expansion and increased cardiac output.  Although this is perfectly normal, if an underlying heart condition exists it can be exacerbated or exposed and require treatment.  Other irregularities may appear with the heart working harder, like changes in rhythm and may or may not require treatment.   Your breasts can grow up to 3 cup sizes while pregnant Breast changes can be one of the earliest signs of pregnancy but did you know they can grow as many as 3 cup sizes while pregnant?  For some this may be one of those fun pregnancy facts but for others it may not be as welcome.  Increasing hormone levels mean changes to blood flow and fluid retention and as the pregnancy progresses the breast tissue prepares for nursing.  Estrogen and progesterone are particularly influential on your breast tissue as well as prolactin, which stimulates both breast growth and milk production.    Your brain changes during pregnancy Baby brain is real and not just an old wive’s tale on changing cognitive function.  New research found that your brain actually gets smaller during pregnancy, but becomes more efficient to prepare for parenthood.  Specific areas, like the front and temporal lobes, experience a loss of gray matter (the part of the brain that performs tasks) but researchers believe it helps new mothers form stronger attachments with their newborn.  And although these changes may last for years after the baby is born, there was no decline seen in cognitive ability.  In fact, it’s as if the changes to the brain are a type of cleaning where the brain gets rid of the clutter and becomes more efficient, effective, and helps the mother respond to the needs of her infant.  Babies can hear mom’s voice in the womb At around 18 weeks, your baby can start to hear and this sense will rapidly develop over the next few weeks.  Many pregnant people sing to their belly or play music for their little one but your baby will hear all sorts of sounds including your heartbeat, blood moving, or even your stomach growling.  But since they are surrounded by fluid, all sounds will be muffled.  That doesn’t mean they can’t hear your voice though.  By the third trimester your baby will not only be able to hear your voice, but will recognize it as well.    Your orgasm can become more intense Thanks to the increased blood flow during pregnancy, your nether regions may be more sensitive leading to more intense orgasms.  The uterus and vaginal area are more engorged and this increase in sensitivity, not to mention raging hormones and an increased libido may make an orgasm during pregnancy more intense, and feel better than it ever has.  Not only is this a safe practice for a low risk pregnancy, but the compounding effect of pregnancy hormones and those released during orgasm can all add up to an intense experience.  And although it’s a popular myth, there’s no truth to orgasm bringing on labor so feel free to enjoy yourself.    Your abs may separate during pregnancy In a condition known as Diastasis Recti, your abdominal muscles may separate from being stretched.  As your uterus expands and this area begins to stretch, the linea alba, or line separating the two sides thins and may even pull apart.  As it gets pushed out it gets wider and the separation can cause your belly to stick out or a bulge to appear.  After the baby is born it will usually shrink back down and there are specific exercises you can do to properly engage the abdominals.  Some exercises can make it worse though so always work with your healthcare provider or a physical therapist who has experience with this condition.  In rare cases, surgery is required but this is a last resort and most people are able to heal with proper exercises.   You may have a stuffy nose Increased blood flow also occurs in your nasal passage and the nasal veins may be enlarged.  An inflammation of the mucous membranes that line the nose can cause nasal congestion and a stuffy nose that just won’t quit.  Pregnancy rhinitis as it’s otherwise known, can last for several weeks and is a relatively small, if not uncomfortable, hassle of pregnancy.  It can lead to complications like sinusitis or ear infections, but even without treatment usually goes away a few weeks after the baby is born. Your nipples change Your breasts can change in a variety of ways with pregnancy.  Your nipples may become noticeably larger and the area around them (areola) may also become darker.  Some women even get stretch marks on their breasts as they grow.  Small painless bumps may appear on the areolas as well but not experiencing these changes is not a cause for concern.  Nipple changes are not an indication of whether you will be able to breastfeed or not.  Hormonal changes are likely the cause and most changes will “return to normal” once you are finished breastfeeding.   Pregnant women can lactate when they hear a baby cry The sound of your baby, or any baby, crying can send a signal to your brain that it’s time to start feeding.  This response is technically known as the milk ejection reflex and more commonly referred to as the let-down response.  This auditory signal basically causes oxytocin to quickly be released which in turn causes the tissue in the breasts to contract and release stored milk.  Although it can be an inconvenient response, it’s nothing to worry about and many use breast pads to absorb the leakage.    Your center of gravity changes As your baby grows, your center of gravity moves forward and you may notice your balance changing.  Coupled with the hormone relaxin working overtime to loosen your ligaments and joints for childbirth, these changes can have an impact on more than just your balance.  Your posture and gait can also change, often leading to the famous “pregnant waddle”.  Since your center of gravity has changed, you are at an increased risk for general clumsiness or even falling.  Be especially careful when performing exercises, wear flat shoes, and use handrails whenever possible.      You can have an orgasm during childbirth Although the evidence for this phenomenon occurs to be largely anecdotal, it is possible to have an orgasm during childbirth.  The same parts of your body that are involved in sexual pleasure are being activated as the baby moves through which in rare circumstances may cause you to orgasm.  Add in the release of certain hormones like oxytocin and although it’s unlikely, orgasm during childbirth can and does happen.  Oxytocin is a natural pain reliever, but even still having an orgasm during birth may be difficult to plan for and more of a rare occurrence than a solid part of your birthing plan. Your due date is not counted from conception Conception is more complicated than just egg meets sperm.  Conception is really a series of steps and  the beginning of pregnancy is actually when the fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall, known as implantation.  But this can be difficult to track with scientific accuracy.  For this and many other reasons, your due date is not counted from conception but rather is based on the day of your last menstrual period.  It can also be calculated via ultrasound but even then it is only an estimate of when your baby will arrive and since we already know that only 5% of babies are born on their due dates, it is merely a guideline.     You become more flexible  During pregnancy, the hormone released to help your pelvic ligaments loosen actually affects all ligaments in your body.  Your overall flexibility may increase but it can be a cause for concern. The loosening effect on your ligaments and other connective tissues may prepare your pelvis for labor and delivery, but it also leaves them more vulnerable to injury and aches and pains.  Don’t overdo it and take steps to protect your ligaments by doing pregnancy safe exercises.       You’ll have more secretions When your body undergoes major hormonal changes, like those experienced in pregnancy, it’s natural to experience vaginal discharge.  The medical term for this is leukorrhea and it not only helps maintain the pH levels in your vagina, it also helps prevent yeast and bacterial infections by maintaining healthy vaginal flora.  Just like vaginal discharge fluctuates throughout your menstrual cycle, it can fluctuate during pregnancy as well.  It will typically increase in amount, and may vary in consistency, thickness, and frequency.  If you are using a fertility tracker such as Mira, you can match the changes in your normal discharge to the specific normal changes in your hormones.  While not all pregnant people experience leukorrhea, many see an increase in mucus production and it may be thicker than your pre-pregnancy discharge.       Your wrinkles can fill Since your skin retains more moisture during pregnancy, it often plumps up and the knock-on effect can mean smoother skin and less wrinkles.  The plumped up skin smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles and contributes to that pregnancy glow.  While it may be beneficial for your wrinkles, it can have a downside.  Too much moisture may make the legs and ankles swell and when the skin is stretched it may feel more sensitive.  Staying well hydrated will not only help your body store less water, it will also benefit your skin. Pressure can make it harder to breathe As the uterus continues to grow, it can begin to press on the diaphragm making it hard for your lungs to fully expand.  This increased pressure may make you feel short of breath and cause more shallow breathing.  The pressure on the lungs and diaphragm will decrease during the last few weeks of pregnancy though, as the baby gets in position for birth by settling into the pelvis.  If you experience shortness of breath or have trouble breathing, it can help to move slowly, sleep propped up, and stay in an upright position to give your lungs more room to expand. You may spot while pregnant Nothing strikes fear into the heart of a pregnant person like spotting, but this is completely normal and as many as 25% of all pregnant people experience some form of spotting.  Although it can indicate problems or complications, it’s perfectly  normal and can happen from conception right through to giving birth.  Spotting can be caused by many things including sex, hormonal changes, infection, cervical changes, or even certain types of tests.  If you are concerned you can always discuss with your doctor but if the spotting is coupled with other symptoms like dizziness or pain it’s always best to seek immediate medical attention to rule out any serious problems.  Keep track of how much you are bleeding and the color of the blood and never use a tampon if you are pregnant.  You may develop heartburn You can blame this extremely common symptom of pregnancy on hormones again.  Just like they relax the ligaments in your pelvis to prepare for birth, they can also relax the valve at the stomach’s entrance.  When this valve doesn’t close the way it should, stomach acid can move up into the esophagus and cause discomfort, otherwise known as heartburn.  More than half of all pregnant people experience heartburn even if they’ve never had it before.  You can find relief in the form of dietary changes or nonprescription heartburn relievers, but your doctor can recommend pregnancy safe alternatives if the pain is more serious.   Your skin can become sensitized to the sun During pregnancy your skin can become generally more sensitive and that includes to the sun as well.  Hormones are the cause of this and the increased sensitivity may make you more susceptible to sunburn or discoloration.  Not only that, but the UV rays of the sun can even break down the folic acid in your body thereby increasing the risk of birth defects.  You don’t need to avoid the sun completely, but make wise choices about sun exposure and use precautions as necessary.      You burn more calories During pregnancy your metabolism increases to meet the demands of the growing fetus.  In fact, pregnant people tend to burn roughly twice as many calories as normal since pregnancy is one of the most “energy-taxing” feats there is. Pregnancy pushes the limits of what the human body can do in many ways, including the amount of energy we can expend.  One study found that the amount of energy expended, or calories burned while pregnant is even comparable to that of endurance athletes.  You may not be running any marathons but your body does need to compensate for the extra needs of a growing baby as everything vies for a piece of the energy you are consuming.  Your body is not only sustaining you, but growing a whole new life and this takes extra energy.  The American Pregnancy Association only recommends an increase of 300 calories per day to make up for these demands.   You knew pregnancy came with some wild and wonderful side effects but did you know there were this many crazy pregnancy facts.  You may only experience some of these, but these fun facts are sure to keep you in awe of just what your body goes through during pregnancy.

Mira cannot guarantee the same results for everyone. Results will depend on each individual’s health conditions. Mira is not intended to diagnose or treat any diseases. Please consult with your doctor.    Megan and her partner had been trying to get pregnant since she’d had her IUD removed in September of 2020, but even though all signs pointed to success, she had a feeling something wasn’t right. With a history of endometriosis and prior surgeries, she knew a physical check up was in order. Doctor’s gave the all clear and said her uterus was fine. And by all accounts it was fine, but there was more going on behind the scenes than meets the eye. With the help of Mira, Megan not only successfully conceived, but advocated for her own health along the way and is feeling more confident than ever as she enters motherhood. Read on to learn how Megan solved her fertility challenges with a little help from Mira’s hormone analysis data.     Challenges getting pregnant Endometriosis, an often painful condition that can make TTC much more challenging, doesn’t spell the end of pregnancy hopes. Although there is no cure for the condition, Megan had successfully treated her endometriosis through surgery and her doctor said her uterus was in great shape. With everything under control, she started using ovulation test strips to identify when she was most fertile and strike while the iron was hot, so to speak. But her hopes were short lived after a positive pregnancy test and then a miscarriage.  The ovulation test strips helped Megan figure out that she was in fact ovulating, but she wasn’t getting pregnant and something still felt off so she was searching for more information.   Looking for more information Doctor’s claimed her uterus was fine, and she knew she was ovulating, but she still wasn’t pregnant. By April of 2021, Megan was almost ready to give up. Not getting answers from doctors, she turned to support groups on Facebook for information and help. It was there she saw an ad for Mira and had a gut feeling that it could get to the bottom of her issues. At the very least, it was worth a shot!   Side note: because of its critical role in ovulation and fertility, monitoring your LH levels is useful to understand when you are most fertile. Traditional OPKs only work on a threshold basis and measure within the range of what is considered “normal”. The Mira Analyzer provides you with information beyond a basic threshold and specifically measures your numerical concentration level of LH.   Armed with test strips and a renewed sense of hope Megan started testing her LH levels to see where she was at. This information helped Megan plan around her fertile window and she liked the numbers she was seeing but it also helped in a way she never expected.   Hormone testing to the rescue Megan finally had concrete data, thanks to the Mira app, that it wasn’t just a feeling – something was off. The numbers don’t lie and even though she had literally just been told her uterus was fine, she still wasn’t pregnant and now she had something to go on. With additional testing using Mira’s Plus wands, Megan took this information to any doctor willing to see.   As anyone struggling with fertility challenges knows, doctors often won’t investigate further until you’ve been trying for at least a year (six months if you’re over 35). Megan didn’t want to wait that full year and had the Mira data to back up her claims. That data proved useful since her doctor used it to immediately order an HSG x-ray. Not only was one fallopian tube fully blocked but the other was affected by a cyst! Megan had still been trying all this time, but ultimately needed an exploratory ablation surgery that left her with one fallopian tube fully removed.   Doctors were confident in Megan’s remaining tube and loved having the Mira numbers. Mira wasn’t the only thing they relied on but it was a huge part of the plan. Not only did it help Megan be her own advocate before the doctors were on board, but it gave the doctors even more information about Megan’s fertility and health overall.

Can you get pregnant if you have endometriosis? Endometriosis and pregnancy Can endometriosis impact fertility? Treating endometriosis FAQs about endometriosis and pregnancy    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       According to John Hopkins Medicine, approximately 2-10% of women ages 25-40 are affected by endometriosis, which can wreak havoc on the reproductive system and cause a lot of pain in the process. For the vast majority of cases, hormonal birth control does the trick to ease symptoms and suppress the spread of endometriosis. However, if you are trying to conceive (TTC), you may need to explore other solutions.  In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about endometriosis, how it affects your ability to get pregnant, and potential treatment options available. We’ll also discuss certain risk factors to be aware of if you are pregnant with endometriosis.  What is endometriosis? Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) grows in patches outside of the uterus where it is not supposed to. Specifically, these patches can grow around the ovaries, on the fallopian tubes, and on the outer surface of the uterus. In rare cases, it can also grow around the intestines, bladder, rectum, cervix, vagina, and vulva.  Those with endometriosis may experience heavy bleeding and severe cramping before and during their period. Other common symptoms include painful intercourse, gastrointestinal problems around the time of menstruation, and difficulties with getting pregnant.  Can you get pregnant if you have endometriosis? Yes. It is still possible to get pregnant even if you have endometriosis. In fact, the pregnancy charity Tommy’s estimates that among women with mild to moderate endometriosis, approximately 70% of them will conceive without needing treatment.         Endometriosis and pregnancy How does endometriosis affect pregnancy? Endometriosis can have a negative impact on your ability to get pregnant. This is demonstrated by the fact that approximately 30-50% of women struggling with infertility have endometriosis.  Even though the reasons why are not fully understood by medical researchers and doctors, there are few generally accepted explanations. These include:  The buildup of excess tissue around the fallopian tubes can interrupt the travel of a fertilized egg from the ovaries to the uterus.   High levels of inflammation can complicate reproductive functioning.  Endometriosis may also reduce ovarian reserve, which can have an impact on egg quantity.  Symptoms of endometriosis can make intercourse painful, resulting in less frequent sex.   Combined, all of these complications due to endometriosis can impede a couple’s efforts to get pregnant.   Are there any risks involved with getting pregnant with endometriosis? Although many individuals with endometriosis go on to have successful pregnancies, there are still potential pregnancy risks and complications to be aware of. This includes increased risk of:  Miscarriage Preterm delivery Ectopic pregnancy Placenta praevia Postpartum hemorrhage   However, it’s important to bear in mind that the severity of these risks will be unique to each individual. If you have endometriosis and are concerned about the health of your pregnancy, speak with your doctor and they can provide the best advice tailored to your situation.   What are your chances of getting pregnant if you have endometriosis? Your chances of getting pregnant with endometriosis will depend on a number of factors including your age, past pregnancies, ovarian reserve, and how severe your endometriosis is. However, for the vast majority of cases, the outlook is positive.  For example, in mild to moderate cases, an estimated 70% of individuals will be able to get pregnant without medical intervention. Public health experts at Jean Hailes for Women’s Health also estimate that among severe cases, approximately 75% will be able to conceive, with a third of these cases likely requiring help from in vitro fertilization (IVF). One practical way that doctors may assess your ability to get pregnant is by using the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI). This index is designed to be used after laparoscopic surgery in order to predict a patient’s chances of natural conception following the procedure. This tool is widely considered as the best and most accurate way to assess the likelihood of potential pregnancy in patients with endometriosis.  How can you improve your chances? Lifestyle changes If you have endometriosis, it’s important to understand that many of the symptoms and side effects are out of your control. However, there are still certain lifestyle factors that you can control to keep your hormones balanced and overall chances of conception high.  This includes:   Maintaining a healthy weight.  Engaging in at least 150 minutes of mild to moderate-intensity exercise each week.  Eating a healthy pre-pregnancy diet. Limiting caffeine intake.  Avoiding potentially harmful substances such as alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. Reducing overall stress levels.   By keeping all of these factors in balance, you will maximize your fertility and chances of getting pregnant.   Reducing inflammation and pain Inflammation due to endometriosis can cause extreme pain, which often leads to more infrequent sex. One way to reduce this inflammation and ease pain is by taking an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication – also known as “NSAIDs”. The most common types of NSAIDs are ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.  Another way to reduce inflammation is by following an endometriosis-friendly diet. Why? Because your body uses food to its advantage to fight inflammation and keep hormone levels in check. If you’ve never followed an anti-inflammatory diet before, here is a brief list of which foods you should eat and avoid.    Foods to eat: fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil,  fish, poultry, and red meat (in moderation).   Foods to avoid: processed foods, sugar, fatty meats, caffeine, and alcohol.   Laparoscopic surgery In cases where lifestyle changes and pain management doesn’t seem to help, laparoscopic surgery may be necessary. The aim of this minimally invasive procedure, often called a “keyhole surgery”, is to remove excess tissue around the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and general pelvic area. Research shows that this can then help to improve chances of natural conception.  Assisted reproductive technology (ART) If lifestyle changes and laparoscopic surgery still doesn’t help you conceive, it’s worth exploring your options for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Depending on your age, medical history, and severity of endometriosis, your doctor may recommend IUI (intrauterine insemination) or IVF (in vitro fertilization) to help you get pregnant.  Can endometriosis impact fertility? Yes. Endometriosis can negatively impact fertility in a number of ways. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine lists the following reasons why this is the case:  Inflammation and distortion of the pelvic structure.  Fallopian tube scarring.  Weakened immune system.  Altered egg quality due to hormonal environment.   Treating endometriosis Even though there is no cure for endometriosis, it is still possible to treat the symptoms in order to reduce pain and achieve your fertility goals.  To get started, consider the following treatment options:  Balancing your overall health by exercising regularly, reducing stress, and maintaining healthy eating patterns.  Reducing inflammation with over-the-counter NSAIDs and an anti-inflammatory diet.  Having excess tissue removed through laparoscopic surgery.   If you are not trying to conceive, hormonal birth control can also help to alleviate symptoms and limit excess tissue growth. If you are trying to conceive, it may also be worth exploring your options for ART with a fertility specialist.  FAQs about endometriosis and pregnancy Can endometriosis cause miscarriage? Endometriosis does not directly cause miscarriage. However, research shows that the increased inflammation caused by endometriosis can be a risk factor for miscarriage (although this is not necessarily true in cases of in-vitro fertilization).  Does endometriosis mean high-risk pregnancy? Yes. If you have endometriosis and you are pregnant, this means that your pregnancy is at a greater risk of experiencing complications.  A meta-analysis published in 2017 found that pregnant women with endometriosis are at a higher risk of experiencing preterm birth, miscarriage, placenta previa, and requiring a cesarean delivery. They are also more likely to give birth to low birth-weight babies.  If you have endometriosis and are currently pregnant, don’t panic. It just means that your doctor will want to monitor your pregnancy more closely.  Should endometriosis be treated differently if you’re TTC? Yes. If you are TTC, your treatment options for endometriosis will be different. Hormonal birth control is one of the most common ways to alleviate symptoms of endometriosis, which is not an option if you are looking to plan a pregnancy.  Instead, your doctor may encourage you to treat your symptoms by following an anti-inflammatory diet or undergoing laparoscopic surgery. If neither of these two treatments work, it’s also possible to pursue fertility treatments such as IVF or IUI.

Understanding Endometriosis How to conceive with endometriosis    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      1 in 10 women has endometriosis, a painful reproductive health condition that can negatively impact fertility. Many women who receive a diagnosis of endometriosis are concerned about whether or not they will be able to get pregnant with the disease.  Thankfully, as many as 70 percent of women with mild-to-moderate endometriosis go on to conceive successfully without in-vitro fertilization (IVF). However, the more extensive the endometriosis is in your body, the more likely it is that you will face challenges conceiving. Read on to learn more about endometriosis, including what this diagnosis may mean for your future fertility. Can You Get Pregnant with Endometriosis? Endometriosis is a complex medical condition that can, unfortunately, make it more difficult for some women with the disease to get pregnant. Somewhere from 30 to 50 percent of women with endometriosis experience infertility. The amount of endometriosis tissue seen on laparoscopy (a type of minimally invasive surgery used to diagnose the condition) is directly linked to your future fertility as a patient with endometriosis. However, just because endometriosis makes it more difficult to get pregnant does not mean it is impossible. Nearly ¾ of women with mild-to-moderate endometriosis go on to conceive within three years without the help of IVF. This means that while the process of getting pregnant may take longer for endometriosis patients, it is still usually possible to conceive naturally with the condition. More extensive endometriosis can lead to the development of scar tissue or adhesions on the reproductive organs. It is thought that the presence of adhesions contributes to infertility in endometriosis patients. Thus, women with more severe endometriosis may require fertility treatment to get pregnant. This can include laparoscopic excision surgery to remove the endometrial-like tissue from the reproductive organs and/or IVF. Understanding Endometriosis Endometriosis is a disorder where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (known as the endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This foreign tissue most often grows on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, and tissue lining the pelvis, but it can grow extra-pelvically as well. In fact, endometriosis has been found on every organ and anatomical structure in the body except the spleen! Endometriosis tissue behaves similarly to the endometrium in that it thickens and bleeds every month during menstruation. Unlike your menstrual flow, however, this tissue has no way to exit the body, and so it becomes trapped. As a result, women with endometriosis may experience inflammation, scarring, and pain. This pain is often most severe during menstruation but can occur during any time of the month. Some women also experience other symptoms and signs of endometriosis, such as constipation or pelvic floor dysfunction. Still, other patients with endometriosis may experience no symptoms at all. Frequently, these women do not find out they have endometriosis until they are trying to get pregnant. Endometriosis Stages Currently, the only way for doctors to diagnose endometriosis is via laparoscopic surgery. This type of surgery is the gold standard for diagnosing and treating endometriosis. In a laparoscopic procedure, a minimally-invasive gynecologic surgeon makes several small incisions in the abdomen. They insert a lighted tube with a camera attached through these incisions and use it to look for evidence of endometriosis in the pelvis. If endometriosis is found, the doctor can remove it (also known as excision) during the same surgery using special tools. During laparoscopic excision surgery, doctors will assign a “stage” to the patient’s endometriosis based on how much tissue they find during the surgery. There are four stages of endometriosis, with stage I being the mildest, and stage IV the most severe. It’s important to note that these stages don’t correlate to the severity of a person’s symptoms — someone with stage IV endometriosis may have no symptoms, while someone with stage I may have debilitating pain. However, the stages of endometriosis can be used to make reliable predictions about a patient’s future fertility. Endometriosis patients with stage III or stage IV endo usually have more difficulty conceiving than patients with stage I or stage II endo. The four stages of endometriosis are:   Stage I refers to the presence of small pockets of endometriosis tissue, with no scar tissue seen on laparoscopic surgery.    Stage II refers to the presence of mild implants of endometriosis affecting less than two inches of the abdomen, with no scar tissue seen on laparoscopic surgery.    Stage III refers to the presence of moderate amounts of endometriosis, which may be deep. There may also be scar tissue and/or special cysts called endometriomas or “chocolate cysts,” which are filled with blood.    Stage IV refers to the presence of extensive amounts of endometriosis. There may also be extensive amounts of scar tissue, especially in the rectovaginal space, and/or large endometriomas.  What causes endometriosis? The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown, but there are several possible explanations: Retrograde menstruation An early theory to explain endometriosis described the process of retrograde menstruation or the backflow of blood and tissue during menstruation. It was thought that endometrial tissue implanted in the pelvis due to retrograde menstruation, causing endometriosis. However, this theory has since been disproven as the true cause of endometriosis. Noting that all women experience retrograde menstruation, but not all women develop endometriosis, scientists have determined that there are more complicated processes at play when it comes to the origins of endometriosis in the body. Transformation of peritoneal cells Another early theory of endometriosis blamed a process called coelomic metaplasia, or the transformation of peritoneal cells (cells in the lining of the abdomen) into endometriosis cells. Scientists have since noted that coelomic metaplasia alone cannot explain endometriosis, since if the disease resulted from the spontaneous transformation of peritoneal cells, it would occur in men as well as women. Later, this theory was combined with retrograde menstruation theory to form induction theory, which proposes that certain biochemicals released by retrograde menstrual flow trigger the transformation of peritoneal cells into endometriosis. Transplantation of endometrial tissue Similar to retrograde menstruation theory, transplantation theory suggests that endometrial tissue can be transported from the uterus to other areas of the body through the lymph or bloodstream. The discovery of endometrial implants in scar tissue after C-section and other abdominal surgeries supports this theory. Studies of monkeys also show that this is possible: when the menstrual flow was diverted into the abdomen in a group of monkeys, half of the monkeys developed peritoneal endometriosis. Embryonic cell transformation One of the most promising explanations of how endometriosis forms is stem cell theory. Stem cells are a special type of cell that forms in the embryo. All cells in the human body form from embryonic stem cells, but some stem cells lose their ability to transform into other kinds of cells. Some of these stem cells are found in the uterus, where they divide to help the endometrium reform after it is shed during menstruation. Building on transplantation theory, the stem cell theory of endometriosis suggests that these types of stem cells migrate to other parts of the body and implant outside the uterus to cause endometriosis. Genetics In addition to the biological mechanisms responsible for how endometriosis forms in the body, scientists have also observed a genetic component to endometriosis. Women are 5 to 8 percent more likely to develop endometriosis if a first-degree relative — such as a mother, sister, or grandmother — also has the disease. Endometriosis is thought to be polygenic, meaning that multiple genes contribute to its development. These genes may be more prevalent in certain racial groups than others: Black women are half as likely to develop endometriosis as white women, and Asian women are 50 percent more likely to develop the disease than white women. Symptoms of endometriosis Women with endometriosis may have anywhere from zero symptoms to severe symptoms of the disease. The primary symptom is pelvic pain, which occurs most often during menstruation. Although many women get period cramps, women with endometriosis experience debilitating pain that frequently gets worse over time. The most common symptoms of endometriosis are:  Painful periods Heavy periods Pelvic pain lasting 6+ months Pain during sex (dyspareunia) Nausea or vomiting during your period Pain with bowel movements and/or urination, especially during your period Constipation and/or diarrhea, especially during your period Rectal bleeding, especially during your period Fatigue Infertility  The severity of your symptoms is not correlated with the extent of the disease. It is possible to have stage IV endometriosis with no symptoms or stage I endometriosis with severe symptoms. Endometriosis risks Endometriosis may increase your risk of certain complications during pregnancy or later in life. Infertility Infertility is a common complication of endometriosis, and especially of stage III and stage IV endometriosis. For pregnancy to occur, the egg must travel through the fallopian tube and be fertilized by the sperm. Severe endometriosis can deform the anatomy around women’s wombs, blocking the egg and sperm from uniting. It also affects a woman’s hormones, which can result in damage to the egg and/or sperm. Miscarriage Some studies suggest there is a strong link between endometriosis and an increased risk of miscarriage. One study found that the increased risk of miscarriage may be as high as 80 percent in some women with endometriosis. More research is needed to understand the exact cause of this relationship. Cancer Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer occurring in the lining of the uterus. Rarely, women with endometriosis may develop a type of endometrial cancer known as endometriosis-associated adenocarcinoma. Women with endometriosis also have an elevated lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Thankfully, most women’s lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with, but it is worth knowing the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer if you have endometriosis.  How to conceive with endometriosis If endometriosis is the underlying cause of your infertility, then treating your endometriosis may improve your chances of conceiving. Here are some of your treatment options when it comes to endometriosis. Laparoscopic excision surgery Laparoscopic excision surgery is the gold standard of treatment for endometriosis. This surgery involves inserting a thin tube with a camera into your abdomen through a small cut in your skin. Your surgeon will then use specialized tools to remove endometriosis tissue from the affected areas. Laparoscopic excision surgery dramatically increases the odds of spontaneous pregnancy in women with moderate to severe endometriosis. An exception is the excision of endometriomas, which improves pregnancy rates but does pose the risk of negatively impacting ovarian reserves. Some surgeons may use another technique called ablation to remove endometriosis. Ablation involves the use of a small laser to burn or cauterize the endometriosis tissue. This type of surgery may be suitable for some superficial endometriosis implants that would be impossible to remove via excision surgery. However, in most cases, ablation should be avoided, as it can result in the creation of scar tissue that may worsen pain and fertility issues. Hormonal treatments Your doctor may recommend the use of hormonal birth control or other hormonal medications to control your endometriosis symptoms. It’s important to note that while hormones can be used to improve your symptoms and potentially slow the growth of implants, they do not cure endometriosis. However, hormonal birth control is obviously not a suitable treatment for women with endometriosis who are trying to conceive — and even if you aren’t ready to get pregnant, you may want to consider the risks to your future fertility. Some hormonal medications used to control endometriosis pose dangerous risks for women’s health and fertility, especially when they are used long-term. Over-the-counter treatments Some women with endometriosis get pain relief from over-the-counter solutions like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and heating pads. These are helpful options for women with endometriosis who are not trying to conceive, but not necessarily suitable for those who are looking to get pregnant soon. Consult your doctor about the use of NSAIDs and heating pads for endometriosis pain relief if you are trying to conceive. Lifestyle You may have seen many discussions on online forums about how diet contributes to endometriosis. The popular “endo diet” encourages women to cut out dietary triggers like gluten, dairy, and nightshades and emphasizes eating anti-inflammatory foods instead. Unfortunately, the reality is that there is little research evidence to show that what we eat affects our odds of conception with endometriosis. Still, many women with endometriosis do suffer from food intolerances that can contribute to their symptoms: for example, as much as 75 percent of women with endo may benefit from a gluten-free diet. Going gluten-free may not help you conceive, but it may improve your quality of life with endometriosis. Assisted reproductive technologies Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) such as Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) or In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) can help women with infertility due to endometriosis conceive faster and more easily. IUI involves placing your partner’s sperm directly into your body. Your doctor may recommend IUI if you have early-stage endometriosis. IUI is often paired with fertility drug treatments, such as Clomid. If IUI with fertility drugs is unsuccessful, IVF treatment is usually the next step. IVF treatment can increase your chances of conceiving, but it is often invasive and expensive. IVF treatment is usually suitable if you have late-stage endometriosis, are over 35 years old, or have other infertility factors. The success rate of IVF treatment varies case-by-case. How to get pregnant with endometriosis naturally If you do not want to undergo invasive surgeries or fertility treatments, it is still possible to get pregnant with endometriosis. Up to 70 percent of women with mild to moderate endometriosis can conceive naturally within three years. Using fertility awareness methods to understand your unique fertility signs and symptoms may increase your odds of conceiving naturally with endo.  You can also try sex positions that help reduce the pain of endometriosis. Understanding your menstrual cycle can help you better identify when you are ovulating so you can time intercourse with your fertile window for the best odds of conception. A natural solution for tracking your menstrual cycle is using a digital fertility monitor like Mira to measure your fertility hormone concentrations. Over time, Mira learns the patterns in your hormones to predict when you are ovulating, helping you time intercourse with your most fertile time of the month.

Can You Still Get Pregnant With Diminished Ovarian Reserve?    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      As you age, your ability to reproduce naturally decreases due to a lower egg count and decreased egg quality. This is known as diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) and can occur due to normal aging, but also due to genetic defects, surgery, injury, and radiation.  Your “ovarian reserve” refers to your reproductive potential based on the number of healthy, viable eggs left in your ovaries. Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have, and this number steadily decreases as you age. To put that into perspective, here are the numbers:  The average woman is born with approximately 2,000,000 eggs By puberty, she has about 400,000 eggs left By her late 30s, she has approximately 27,000 eggs By the onset of menopause, about 1,000 eggs remain  While it’s not the most fun topic, the “biological clock” is a real thing for most women and understanding how to recognize and overcome diminished ovarian reserve is crucial for anyone looking to conceive later on in life. This article is purely educational. The Mira Hormone Monitor is not designed to check ovarian reserve. Please always refer to your healthcare provider. What Is Diminished Ovarian Reserve? As you age, the number of eggs in your ovaries steadily decreases. Some women do not follow this pattern and can begin to lose their reserve more quickly or stay fertile after 40. However, when diagnosing diminished ovarian reserve levels, yours are compared to population averages. If you have fewer eggs than other women your age, you are considered to suffer from DOR. Everyone’s reserve is different, but on average each woman starts out life with around 2,000,000 eggs. As you age, you lose eggs naturally and by the time you enter puberty, you have around 400,000 remaining. By your late 30s, you have around 27,000 eggs left and this continues to decrease as you enter menopause. At the beginning of menopause, most women only have around 1,000 eggs remaining. According to the Center for Human Reproduction, about 10% of women are diagnosed with DOR prior to the age of 40. If you have been diagnosed with DOR, know that there are treatment options available — and that there are plenty of success stories of women who have gotten pregnant despite DOR! What Causes Diminished Ovarian Reserve? Every woman loses eggs as she ages. However, some women lose eggs faster than the general population, leading to a diagnosis of DOR. Other causes of DOR, besides natural aging, can include:   Cigarette smoking: The chemicals in cigarettes speed the loss of eggs. In general, the risk of fertility problems increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.    Genetic abnormalities: Genetic disorders like Fragile X syndrome are associated with lower ovarian reserve.    Pelvic infections: Untreated infections can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which decreases ovarian reserve.    Autoimmune disease: Certain autoimmune diseases can attack any organ in the body. If they attack the ovaries, your ovarian reserve may become diminished.    Chemotherapy and radiation: Cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation to the ovaries can decrease ovarian reserve, making it more difficult to get pregnant.    Endometriosis: Both superficial endometriosis and endometriomas (“chocolate cysts”) can potentially decrease ovarian reserve.    Pelvic surgery: If surgery requires the removal of large amounts of ovarian tissue, it could impact your ovarian reserve.  Idiopathic: Unfortunately, not all cases of DOR have a clear cause — this is known as “idiopathic” DOR.  There is still a lot we don’t know about DOR, and there might be additional causes of DOR that don’t appear on this list. Thankfully, research is still being done on the condition and will hopefully provide more insight into causes and treatments in the future. What Are The Symptoms of Diminished Ovarian Reserve? DOR can be a hard condition to accurately diagnose. There are often no physical signs of diminished ovarian reserve, but there are a few symptoms that might hint at the possibility:  Irregular or missed periods Heavy menstrual flow Difficulty conceiving Repeated miscarriages  Many women do not find out they have DOR until they undergo diagnostic fertility tests, such as a transvaginal ultrasound or hormone testing. How is Diminished Ovarian Reserve Diagnosed? The only way to accurately diagnose the condition of DOR is with lab testing. Blood tests can measure the levels of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) to see if they point to DOR. Those with the condition experience elevated FSH and low AMH compared to others in their age group. The Mira Fertility Tracker cannot officially diagnose diminished ovarian reserve, but it can give you an idea if your FSH might be higher than usual. Tracking your hormones at home with Mira can help you get to know your typical hormone curve and if your fertility hormones follow a normal pattern. Doctors can estimate the number of eggs you have left based on these hormone levels, but it’s impossible to determine the exact number of eggs you have in reserve. It can, however, tell you your fertility potential and whether you have levels similar to others in your age group. If your numbers are lower than those of other women your age, your doctor may diagnose DOR.  What Are The Treatments for Diminished Ovarian Reserve? It may come as a relief to learn that you can still get pregnant with DOR! Some women are able to conceive naturally, but more often, women with DOR conceive with the use of fertility treatments. Your best chance of getting pregnant is with early diagnosis and individualized treatment. If you are trying to get pregnant naturally, it is important to know when your fertile window is. Fewer eggs available means you need to time intercourse with ovulation to improve the odds of conception (and ensure the quality of your eggs). Using a fertility tracker like Mira can help you track your cycle. However, the majority of women with diminished ovarian reserve looking to get pregnant require fertility treatments to conceive. The most common treatments include:   Fertility preservation is often the first step if DOR is caught early. This treatment includes retrieving eggs and freezing them for later in vitro fertilization (IVF).  DHEA supplementation helps increase naturally diminishing levels of this androgen and increases the number and quality of eggs retrieved for IVF.  Ovarian stimulation with injectable hormones is another treatment for increasing the number of eggs available for IVF. Use of donor eggs from a younger woman has the highest success rate for those with DOR.  It is important to note that DOR cannot be reversed with any treatment. Therefore, women who have fewer high-quality eggs still suffer more miscarriages even with IVF. Each treatment option has its own set of risks and success rates. You should discuss all of your fertility options with your doctor to make the right choice for you and your family. Can You Still Get Pregnant With Diminished Ovarian Reserve? Yes, you can still get pregnant with diminished ovarian reserve! The good news is that while you may require fertility treatments to help you conceive, many women with DOR are still able to start their families. Some women require donor eggs or adopted embryos, but many are able to have biological children. Having DOR might make the road to conception longer or more challenging for you, but it doesn’t mean that you cannot get pregnant. Diminished Ovarian Reserve Success Stories If you have a diagnosis of DOR, you might be worried about whether or not you’ll be able to get pregnant. It might make you feel better to know that many women have been able to successfully get pregnant despite a diagnosis of DOR. Here are some stories of women like you who managed to conceive with diminished ovarian reserve. Success Story #1: Bonnie  Bonnie and her husband Casey spent six years trying to get pregnant — and documenting the process on their YouTube channel. After a test showed she had low AMH, Bonnie was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve and underwent in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Eventually, after she became pregnant, she gave birth to not one baby but triplets! Success Story #2: April  At 36, April was diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve, with only 11 follicles available to become mature eggs. Her doctor told her the odds for a woman with her egg count to get pregnant were only around 20%. However, after over two years on her infertility journey, she successfully beat the odds and became pregnant with her daughter Nora. (Hot tip: she recommends the book It Starts with the Egg!) Success Story #3: Christine  Christine’s infertility story was harder than most because both she and her husband had their own fertility issues. Not only did Christine have diminished ovarian reserve, but her husband also had bilateral varicoceles, a condition affecting his sperm quality. After going through both intrauterine insemination (IUI) and IVF, she was able to conceive and gave birth in February 2021. As these success stories show, it’s definitely possible to get pregnant with diminished ovarian reserve! While many women require the help of IVF to get pregnant, a diagnosis of DOR does not mark the end of your journey toward starting a family.

However, when it comes to getting pregnant in the first place, your diet is just as important before conception as it is afterward. That’s because your pre-pregnancy diet can have an impact on things like:  Your hormones and ovulation patterns Likelihood of conceiving The health of your baby in its early phases of development.  In this post, we will take a look at the purpose of pre-pregnancy diets, what types of foods you should focus on (and avoid) if you are trying to conceive, and practical ways for starting your pre-pregnancy diet today.  Pre-pregnancy diet goals It’s easy to think, “I’m not pregnant yet, why do I need to worry about my diet right now?”. And while you may not need to say “no” to your occasional glass of wine or morning cappuccino right away, it’s still important to understand how your diet and certain fertility foods can impact your chances of conceiving. One initial risk factor to consider is your weight. What we eat influences our weight and BMI, and if your BMI is too low or too high, your chances of becoming pregnant are adversely affected. Additionally, certain types of foods such as processed meats, potatoes, and sugary snacks/beverages are also known to have a negative impact on fertility. Ultimately, by maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy diet, you can:  Boost fertility and improve your chances of conceiving. Establish a healthy routine before becoming pregnant. Prevent pregnancy-related complications such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure. Reduce the risk of your baby suffering from a birth defect, such as spina bifida or anencephaly. Prevent the need to require a C-section due to weight gain.  Unfortunately, there is no single, specific type of food to ensure pregnancy. However, there are some basic dietary and lifestyle guidelines you can follow to not only maximize your chances of getting pregnant, but to also create a nutrient-rich environment for a baby. Here are a few tips to get started. Pre-pregnancy diet tips What nutrients should you be focusing on? Folic acid/folate Folic acid, also known as Vitamin B9 is a nutrient that promotes healthy cell growth, helps to prevent birth defects, and may improve levels of progesterone in some women. You can find folic acid in a number of foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts, and bananas. Folic acid is also found in many prenatal vitamins and can also be taken as a standalone supplement.        Fiber Fiber is another great nutrient to consume pre-pregnancy as it helps you stay satiated after meals and can help to keep your blood sugar regulated. Foods rich in fiber include green peas, beans and lentils, berries, nuts, seeds, whole grain bread, pasta, and cereals. Iron Another essential nutrient for your pre-pregnancy diet is iron, which can be found in meat, eggs, beans, and leafy green vegetables. Iron not only helps to boost your energy levels, but by consuming plenty of iron-rich foods pre-pregnancy, you can build up critical iron reserves necessary for growing a healthy baby. Calcium The next nutrient on the list is Calcium, which is prominent in many dairy products like cheese, yogurt, and low-fat milk. Calcium is not only important for keeping your bones healthy and strong, but it can also help to keep your circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems regulated. Omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3 fatty acids, found in leafy green vegetables, flax seeds, nuts, and fish products, are not only critical for the early development stages of a fetus, but they can also help to prevent depression during and after pregnancy. One of the best ways to consume plenty of Omega-3’s is through a prenatal vitamin and/or a fish oil supplement. Protein Protein-rich foods are also worth incorporating into your pre-pregnancy diet plan. Foods rich in protein can help you stay fuller for longer, reduce your desire for unhealthy snacks, and keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. Some examples of high-protein foods include lean meats and poultry, broccoli, beans and lentils, and nuts. What foods should you eat when trying to get pregnant? Greens Leafy green vegetables are packed with three key nutrients necessary for the early phases of pregnancy including iron, folates, and Omega-3 fatty acids. Consider eating plenty of kale, spinach, romaine lettuce, collard greens, and watercress if you are trying to conceive. Of all the potential foods to get pregnant faster, leafy green vegetables are one of the best choices given their versatility and relatively low-calorie counts. Lean meat Lean meats such as chicken breast, beef tenderloin, and pork loin are all high in protein. When incorporated into your diet consistently, these lean meats can help you to stay satiated for longer and maintain a healthy pre-pregnancy weight. Fish Certain types of fish are an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids, which can help to promote healthy fetal development, alleviate symptoms of depression, and in some cases can even improve sleep quality. If you’re worried about exposure to mercury, try to stick with options like salmon, shrimp, sardines, and tilapia. Dairy Dairy products are high in calcium, protein, and vitamin D, which can all contribute to a healthy prenatal diet. It is recommended to get around three servings of milk or other dairy products such as Greek yogurt or cottage cheese daily if you are trying to get pregnant. Beans Beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, iron, and calcium – all of which can support healthy bone and muscle growth for you and your baby in the first trimester. Not only that, but beans can help you to stay fuller for longer throughout the day. Chickpeas, kidney beans, and lentils are all in the bean/legume family and would be suitable to incorporate into your pre-pregnancy diet. Nuts Nuts are another great source of fiber, protein and Omega-3 fatty acids, making them a healthy option for snacking or adding to salads. The nuts with the highest levels of protein include almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and cashews. Citrus fruits Some of the best fertility foods when trying to get pregnant include citrus fruits like lemons, oranges, and grapefruits, all of which are high in both calcium and folate. As mentioned previously, folate is helpful for regulating pre-pregnancy hormones and promoting healthy cell growth for you and your baby. Whole grains Whole grains are packed with iron, fiber, and folates. In addition to reducing your risk of weight gain, the nutrients found in whole grains can also help to regulate your pre-pregnancy hormones and maintain healthy blood sugar levels. A few whole grains to incorporate into your diet include brown rice, oats, quinoa, rye bread, and whole wheat pasta. What should you avoid? Processed meats Consuming high levels of processed meats such as salami, sausages, and lunch meat while trying to conceive can increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes once pregnant. While it’s okay to have an occasional slice of pepperoni pizza or ham sandwich, try to keep processed meats to a minimum while on your fertility diet. Soft drinks and sodas Soft drinks and sodas are extremely high in sugar, and if drank regularly, can contribute to weight gain and negatively impact fertility. Try to save sugary soft drinks as a weekend treat, and replace your daily soda with something healthier such as water or low-fat milk. Artificial sweeteners Even though artificial sweeteners may help you to cut back on sugar, they may also decrease your chances of conceiving and potentially be harmful to an embryo. If you’re not a fan of plain water, opt for squeezing a fresh orange or lemon in your water instead of using a flavored sweetener. Caffeine Caffeine should also be avoided while trying to get pregnant as it can both reduce fertility and prevent your body from absorbing critical nutrients. You do not have to give up your morning coffee altogether though – simply try to stay below 200 milligrams of caffeine daily and your fertility rates should be unaffected. A few foods to watch that contain caffeine include tea, chocolate, soft drinks, and energy drinks. Alcohol Consuming alcohol is known to hinder your chances of getting pregnant. Not only that, but it can be harmful to your fetus in the early stages of development. If you tend to drink alcohol socially, opt for a citrusy mocktail instead and nobody will know that it is alcohol-free. Cigarettes It is estimated that women who smoke are approximately 2X more likely to suffer from infertility compared to women who do not smoke. Quitting smoking is no easy task, however, but it’s essential if you are trying to conceive and have a healthy pregnancy. Lifestyle tips when trying to get pregnant. Practice mindfulness Mindfulness is simply taking a few moments each day to reflect, breathe, and focus on the present moment. This not only helps you to more effectively manage stress (which can be detrimental to conception), but it can help you to feel more relaxed, sleep better, and develop a more positive outlook on life. Healthy sleep Maintaining good sleep hygiene when trying to conceive is crucial for hormone regulation, stress management, and appetite control. To ensure that your body gets enough sleep, try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. You should also try to avoid caffeine in the afternoons, limit the use of your smartphone in the evenings, and create a relaxing sleep environment in your bedroom. Don’t skip working out Getting regular exercise is critical for maintaining your weight, building strong muscles, and reducing stress and anxiety. Remember though, not all exercise has to be high-impact like running or lifting weights at the gym. Simply going for a walk for 30 minutes per day is a great way to stay physically fit and healthy. Take supplements You might not be able to have the perfect diet every single day – but that’s okay! Taking pre-pregnancy supplements such as prenatal vitamins and folic acid is an absolute must for ensuring your body gets all the right nutrients consistently.

It’s still important to consume lots of veggies, whole grains, and lean proteins while trying to get pregnant. Pre-pregnancy diet plan: Where to start If you’ve read through this list, you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed about how to realistically implement these changes into your real life. To help you get started, here are a few quick tips for building the best pre-pregnancy diet for you and your lifestyle.  Start small. Big changes to your diet can start with small, incremental changes. Instead of overhauling your diet completely, try to incorporate some new fertility recipes & foods slowly. If your family prefers the more “meat and potato” style meals, try to add in some healthy vegetables like spinach, broccoli, or kale. Over time, these small changes can add up and even be refined further. Make replacements. There are several simple replacements that you can make to get some healthier foods into your diet. For example, opt for a leaner cut of meat the next time you go out for a meal, or buy brown rice instead of white rice the next time you’re at the grocery store. Simple replacements like this can make a huge difference in your overall diet and health. Be consistent. When working towards your pre-pregnancy diet, it’s better to prioritize consistency above all else. Instead of trying to implement a completely different meal plan than what you’re accustomed to, make a few small changes and replacements that you can maintain consistently. Consistent changes will eventually become healthy habits that you won’t have to think twice about!  The most important tip of all though is to be kind to yourself. It’s easy to get frustrated or disappointed with ourselves when we give in to that tempting treat at the movies or forget to take our prenatal vitamin one morning. If this happens – and it’s bound to happen a few times – never forget that each day is a clean slate and you can try again tomorrow. Mistakes are totally normal, and being kind and compassionate to yourself is paramount for staying relaxed and healthy while trying to conceive.

Can you become infertile from smoking weed? How weed affects male fertility? How long after quitting smoking weed does male fertility improve? How weed affects female fertility? How to Quit? Conclusion    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         Cannabis and marijuana legalization is on the rise which means the use of cannabis is on the rise as well.  Cannabis’ negative effects on sperm are well known but how long after quitting smoking marijuana does male fertility improve? Given the increasing popularity and legality of cannabis, it’s no surprise that many people want to know how cannabis affects fertility. What are the effects on sperm and sperm count? Can cannabis make you infertile? How does smoking marijuana affect female fertility? At Mira, we are always on the hunt for how things impact your fertility. In this article, we’ll answer these questions and more as we look into the research on how smoking cannabis may affect your fertility.    Does smoking weed affect fertility? The truth of the matter is that smoking cannabis can have many negative effects on your fertility.  Your reproductive system essentially operates on a complex feedback loop. Anything that interferes with that system will negatively impact fertility.  It can wreak havoc on your hormones and disrupt the entire reproductive system. Not only does it lower testosterone in males, but in females it can lower both testosterone and estrogen. Results like lower sperm counts, ovulation delays, and even increased risk of miscarriage are all common consequences of how using THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) can affect your fertility.           Can you become infertile from smoking weed? Although there’s no conclusive evidence that smoking marijuana causes you to be infertile, it does have a host of other negative outcomes for the reproductive system.  The active ingredient in marijuana, THC, acts on our endocannabinoid system.  This complex system is especially important for reproduction and any interruptions can interfere and wreak havoc with many of the body’s reproductive functions.  Since the endocannabinoid system is involved in every aspect of fertility, smoking cannabis can even exacerbate existing fertility issues and make it that much harder to get pregnant. The truth is, ethical limitations mean it’s nearly impossible to study how cannabis affects fertility and whether it can make you infertile.  This means there are critical gaps in our knowledge of how THC affect both male and female fertility.  Since our conclusions are based on observational research and anecdotal evidence we don’t fully know the impacts of these substances even though we know they are linked with reproductive dysfunction.  How weed affects male fertility? Marijuana’s impacts on male fertility are more well known.  From our research, we know that          men who regularly smoke marijuana have lower sperm counts.  We don’t fully know the long term impact it has on fertility and sperm health.  Sperm have cannabinoid receptors on them so any use of the substance has the potential to disrupt sperm function.  We know that studies have shown reductions in sperm count and concentration, but there’s an increasing body of evidence to show that it also affects shape, motility, and viability, not to mention its impact on male hormones.  In fact, research suggests that the more someone uses marijuana, the lower their sperm count will be.In order to get pregnant, you need healthy sperm that can get where they need to go.  If your sperm quality is off, it can impact whether or not you can fertilize an egg and successfully conceive. Lower testosterone levels caused by smoking may result in lower sperm production, erectile dysfunction, abnormal sperm and a lower sex drive which can all contribute to infertility in men. How long after quitting smoking weed does male fertility improve? Sperm takes more than two months to be produced so it can take at least that long to improve sperm quality once you quit smoking.  For chronic users, marijuana lingers in the body and can take weeks to leave your system whereas casual users may rebound quicker.  Dietary supplements and lifestyle changes may help your system while it recovers from marijuana’s effects on sperm.  How weed affects female fertility? We know that THC can impact many systems in our body and cause a wide range of effects.  When it comes to female fertility, this disruption to the system can mean changes in ovulation, hormonal imbalances, and a possible increased risk of miscarriage.  Not to mention that marijuana crosses the placenta and can impact the fetus, so marijuana use while TTC is strongly discouraged.    The truth is though, we don’t have enough human studies to determine how marijuana impacts female fertility or how the effects play out long term.  We do know that it could impact your chances of conception in a variety of ways and can have negative outcomes for both pregnancy and childbirth.  The studies we do have show a potential negative association between cannabis use and issues with the menstrual cycle, reproductive hormones, time it takes to get pregnant, and even infertility treatments.    Unlike men, who are always producing new sperm, women are born with a lifetime supply of eggs.  Once eggs die, or become damaged, they will never be replaced.  Although we don’t know all of the detrimental effects smoking cannabis has on female fertility, we do know that it has negative implications for your overall reproductive health so it is best not to smoke at all while TTC.  Research still can’t answer the question of how long after quitting smoking does female fertility improve for cannabis but when it comes to cigarettes, it can take up to a year to see improvements.       Recommended for you Navigate your fertility with peace of mind         Mira Max Starter Kit Includes 10 Max Wands         Mira Fertility Tea 20 tea bags, 1.5G per unit         Mira Prenatal Vitamins 60 capsules, 30 servings         Mira Clarity Bundle Includes 10 MAX & 10 Ovum Wands      How to Quit? Quitting any habit can be a hard task but even more so when it involves a chemical cocktail that makes you feel good.  It can take time and every person approaches the task differently.  Some people prefer the “cold turkey” method while others slowly downgrade their usage over time until they have finally quit.  Whatever method you choose, find support or talk to your doctor to help ease the transition.   Conclusion As you can see, it’s important to know the impact smoking cannabis can have on your fertility.  Due to ethical considerations and other challenges, research in the area is limited.  We know that smoking cannabis has a variety of negative effects on both the male and female reproductive system.  These effects may or may not negatively impact your fertility but they most certainly can affect your overall health, which in turn may impact your fertility.  If you are trying to conceive, or preparing for the possibility, the safest approach is to not smoke so you can avoid any negative effects on you or a developing fetus.  Ultimately more research is needed to know the full effects cannabis can have on fertility.  Talk to your healthcare provider to help you move forward in the safest way possible.          Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Mucus plugs and pregnancy Losing your mucus plug When to see a doctor Signs you are in labor after losing your mucus plug Mucus plug FAQ    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       As a pregnant woman, you’re probably already used to life with more vaginal discharge than normal. However, as you approach the end of your pregnancy, it’s important to be aware of one key event that can look very similar to heavy discharge: losing your mucus plug. If you’ve never heard about the mucus plug before or don’t quite know what to expect – you’re in the right place! This article will cover everything you need to know about what a mucus plug is, what it looks like, and when you can expect to lose it. We’ll also cover other early signs of labor and situations where you should contact your doctor.  What is a mucus plug? A mucus plug is a collection of jelly-like mucus that forms inside the cervix during pregnancy. Its purpose is to act as a barrier between the vagina and the uterus. This helps to protect the pregnancy by preventing potentially harmful bacteria and viruses from entering the uterus.  The mucus plug is eventually expelled through the vagina sometime before labor and often resembles heavy discharge. Because every pregnancy and body is different, the release of the mucus plug can occur anywhere from a few weeks to a few hours before labor.  Mucus plugs and pregnancy What does a mucus plug look like? Inside the body, the mucus plug sits inside the cervical canal between the vagina and uterus. It is a thick, “gloopy” collection of mucus that is no more than 2 tablespoons in volume. In terms of color, the mucus plug can range from clear, white, off-white, yellow, pink, red, or brown.  Losing your mucus plug When do you lose your mucus plug? According to the American Pregnancy Association, the mucus plug is typically released sometime after week 37 of pregnancy. While some women lose their mucus plug all in one go, it’s also perfectly normal to lose it gradually in the final days or weeks of pregnancy.  If you are approaching labor and still haven’t lost your mucus plug, don’t worry! Some women do not lose their mucus plug until they are actually in labor.  If you haven’t reached 37 weeks of pregnancy yet but think that you have already lost your mucus plug, it’s a good idea to go ahead and speak with your doctor. They can perform any necessary checks and offer reassurance on the health of your pregnancy.   What does mucus plug discharge look like? When the mucus plug is released from the body, it looks very similar to heavy discharge. For example, it can be clear, white, off-white, or even yellowish in color. In some cases, it may have blood in it which may cause it to have a red, pink, or brown tinge.  A typical mucus plug can be anywhere from 1-2 tablespoons in volume and 1-2 inches in length, and it can feel stringy, stretchy, or gooey to the touch.  What can cause you to lose your mucus plug? There are a few different events that may cause you to lose your mucus plug.  For example, even though it’s safe to have sex while pregnant, sexual intercourse can disrupt the mucus plug resulting in its release. As you approach your 37-week milestone of pregnancy, try to be aware of this and proceed carefully when having sex with your partner. If you are less than 37 weeks pregnant and think that you’ve lost your mucus plug due to sex, it’s a good idea to speak with your doctor just to be on the safe side.   In addition to sex, a cervical exam is another potential event that may lead to the loss of the mucus plug. That’s because this exam may disrupt the opening of the cervix, causing your mucus plug to become dislodged. Again, if this occurs prior to 37 weeks, speak with your doctor immediately.  Finally, nature has its own way of passing the mucus plug by dilating and softening the cervix. This process is completely normal and necessary for preparing the body for delivery, and it typically occurs sometime in the final three weeks of pregnancy.  When does labor start after losing your mucus plug? After losing your mucus plug, labor can start anytime within the next weeks, days, or even hours if you’re closer to full term. However, it’s important to bear in mind that every pregnancy is different, with some women losing their mucus plug relatively early and others losing it as late as during labor itself.   Signs to look out for when losing your mucus plug One of the tell-tale signs that you’ve lost your mucus plug is the presence of extra mucus that looks like discharge in your underwear or on a piece of toilet paper. This shouldn’t be painful or cause any major side effects, however, it is normal for the loss of a mucus plug to also be accompanied by early symptoms of labor such as cramping, contractions, or even membrane rupturing (i.e. your water breaking).  Upon losing your mucus plug, try to take note of what it looks like, how large it is, when it came out, and any associated symptoms. Your doctor or midwife may want to know this information the next time that they speak with you.  When to see a doctor There are a few situations where you should contact your doctor upon losing your mucus plug. This includes all of the following scenarios:  You have lost your mucus plug before week 37 of pregnancy.  Losing your mucus plug was exceptionally painful. You lost large amounts of blood alongside your mucus plug.  Your mucus plug is green or bright yellow in color. Your mucus plug has a foul-smelling odor. You experienced a large rush of fluid after losing your mucus plug.   Speak with your doctor immediately if you have experienced any of the above, and they can further assess your situation and pregnancy.   Signs you are in labor after losing your mucus plug Contractions As you approach labor, your uterine muscles will periodically tighten and then relax. When this happens, it means you are experiencing contractions, and contractions help to make vaginal deliveries possible. Many women describe contractions as feeling like cramping, tightening, or pressure that comes in waves, typically starting in the lower back before moving to the abdomen.          In early labor, contractions may be short, mild, and irregular. However, as you progress through labor, your contractions will increase in intensity, occur more regularly, and last up to 70 seconds.   Once you begin experiencing contractions, take note of their timings and intensity. If they become stronger and occur in more regular intervals, it’s probably time to make your way to the hospital.  Labor contractions should not be confused with Braxton Hicks Contractions, which can begin as early as the second trimester. Unlike labor contractions, Braxton Hicks Contractions are spontaneous, unpredictable, and typically only last 15-30 seconds.   Membranes rupturing When the amniotic that surrounds your baby ruptures, it causes a rush of fluid to leave your body through your vagina. This is more commonly known as your “water breaking”, and it can cause contractions to either begin or intensify. While many women experience their water breaking all at once, it’s also normal for the fluid to trickle through in small amounts. When you suspect that your water has broken, you should head to the hospital immediately.  Lightening Lightening or “dropping” is the process where your baby will settle lower into your pelvis in order to get into a good position for labor. In some cases (typically with first pregnancies), lightening can occur as early as one month before delivery. However, in women who have had prior pregnancies, lightening may not occur until labor. Unless it is accompanied by other symptoms such as your water breaking or frequent contractions, lightening alone is not a sign that you are in labor and need to go to the hospital.  Cramping Cramping and intense pain are other signs of labor. While much of the cramping sensation is due to contractions, it can also be caused by your baby putting pressure on your cervix, bladder, and bowels. This type of pain and cramping can be felt in the abdomen, back, groin, thighs, and everywhere in between. Many women describe this pain as feeling like menstrual cramping, while others describe it as similar to gastrointestinal cramping (such as when you have diarrhea).  If your water hasn’t broken yet but your cramping and contractions increase in intensity, it’s a good idea to give your healthcare provider a call and describe your symptoms. They can let you know whether it’s the right time to head to the hospital.  Mucus plug FAQ Can I go into labor without losing my mucus plug?  Yes. You can still go into labor even if you don’t think that you’ve lost your mucus plug. In some cases, the mucus plug does not come out until the middle of labor. In other cases, the mucus plug may have already been lost in small amounts prior to labor without being noticed.  What’s the difference between losing mucus plug and discharge?  Vaginal discharge during pregnancy (often referred to as leukorrhea) is typically clear, white, milky white, or yellowish in color with a thin texture. While you may experience more discharge during pregnancy than you did prior to pregnancy, it will not be exceptionally heavy.  A mucus plug on the other hand will be much thicker and heavier than standard discharge. Oftentimes it comes out in a “blob”, which can be up to 2 inches in length. Its texture is often described as stringy or “gooey”, and it can be stretched between your fingers. While its color is similar to standard discharge, it may also have streaks of red, pink, or brown blood in it.  How early can I lose my mucus plug?  The earliest that it is safe to lose a mucus plug is at 37 weeks of pregnancy. If it is lost before then, you should speak with your doctor.  Can I lose my mucus plug slowly?  Yes. Sometimes the mucus plug does not come out all at once. Instead, it can come out in smaller pieces over several weeks. When this happens, most women do not even realize that they have lost parts of their mucus plug and instead mistake it for normal discharge. This is perfectly normal and nothing to be concerned about.  Can I get an infection after losing my mucus plug? Losing your mucus plug after 37 weeks is completely safe and is not likely to cause infection. If you have lost your mucus plug prior to 37 weeks, this does not necessarily mean that you will get an infection. However, it could increase your risk of infection or preterm labor which is why it’s important to speak with your doctor immediately if you have lost your mucus plug prior to week 37 of pregnancy.

How much should you expect to pay?    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      Ovulation test strips, urine based hormone tests usually done at home, are a key tool in any fertility journey. When trying to conceive, pinpointing your fertile window is of the utmost importance. Ovulation is short and knowing your window can give you the best chance to conceive.  While there are many ways to calculate and track your fertile window, ovulation tests help you maximize your likelihood of becoming pregnant by detecting hormone surges related to ovulation indicating when you’re most fertile. Knowing your fertile window means you’ll know when intercourse is most likely to result in a pregnancy. If you’re looking to maximize the likelihood of becoming pregnant, tests like these can help you take control of your fertility. How do ovulation tests work? By now, we’re all familiar with the pee-on-a-stick pregnancy tests found on the market today.    Ovulation tests are similar in design but are used to indicate your fertile window, rather than whether you are pregnant or not. But are they reliable? While pregnancy tests detect human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in your urine, ovulation test strips work by detecting luteinizing hormone (LH). LH levels remain steady during your menstrual cycle except for a surge that happens just before ovulation.  Ovulation tests detect this surge to tell you when you’re in your fertile window and therefore when you’re most likely to conceive. If you’re trying to get pregnant, intercourse at the right time is essential. Your fertile window includes the 4-5 days leading up to ovulation until 24 hours after is the time in your cycle when you are most likely to get pregnant.  Ovulation test strips help you time your fertile window effectively giving you a greater shot at conceiving successfully.  Keep in mind they may not work for everyone, aren’t a guarantee you’ll get pregnant, and are only one tool available on your fertility journey.   What are ovulation test strips and how do they work? Ovulation test strips and ovulation predictor kits are at-home tests used to measure the hormones that indicate ovulation. You can use these tests to determine when you are ovulating and time intercourse accordingly for your best chance of success. They come in two forms: threshold-based and semi-quantitative. Threshold-based tests give a positive or negative result based on whether you are above or below a certain level of LH (based on a standard level). Semi-quantitative tests measure LH levels in a way that signifies whether you are low, high, or peak. Some ovulation predictor kits also measure estrogen, typically detectable a few days before LH surges, giving you even more information to confirm your fertile window.  Tests like these can be especially helpful if your health deviates in any way from population averages. Test strip pros and cons On one hand, test strips are fairly easy to use and are done in the privacy of your own home. But on the other hand, they aren’t foolproof and if not used correctly they won’t necessarily help you. There are both pros and cons to ovulation test strips and fertility strips and they all carry different levels of importance for each person: Pros  Women find them easier to use than methods like the basal body temperature method (BBT) because you don’t have to remember to keep a thermometer by your bed or worry about night waking affecting results. Test strips are more effective than BBT in detecting ovulation as BBT only confirms ovulation rather than predicts it. Kits and strips are widely available online or over the counter at drugstores, pharmacies, and some major supermarkets, without a prescription. More comfortable for some women than tests like checking for cervical mucus to detect changes in ovulation. Ovulation test strips are more convenient than other methods since they don’t need to be used right when you get up and are easy to use.  Cons  Tests can give false results, either a false positive or a false negative, especially if your LH levels vary from cycle to cycle. Some women have trouble reading the results and find the second line difficult to interpret.  Is it dark enough for a positive result? This can be difficult particularly if you don’t get a very strong LH surge and the line is weak to begin with. OPKs rarely work for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and other cycle irregularities. It’s possible for LH to surge and an egg to never release, so they can’t actually confirm that ovulation has happened. Using ovulation test strips month after month, if you are having trouble conceiving or your cycles are irregular, can become expensive. OPKs do not work reliably when certain fertility drugs are present in the system.  For example, injectable fertility drugs like Pergonal or hCG can severely limit their reliability. Fertility strips may not work consistently on women over 40 due to changes in LH levels.  In their 40s, some women have increased levels of LH in their systems at all times, making any results from ovulation test strips invalid.  OPK vs ovulation test strips Ovulation predictor kit, or OPK, and the term ovulation test strip are used interchangeably when it comes to talking about fertility test strips. OPK test strips, also known as ovulation test strips and fertility strips, all work the same way. No matter what terminology you use, they work by detecting levels of LH hormone in your urine. A spike in LH, also known as an LH surge, indicates that ovulation is on the horizon and now is the best time to have intercourse. How to use ovulation test strips Ovulation test strips either inserted into the urine stream or in a cup of urine you have collected. The strips have two lines including a control line to let you know the test was used properly, and a second line to indicate the results of the test. When first inserted into the urine, the control line should appear. If this line does not appear you should use a new strip. A second line, usually darker than the control line, appears when LH exceeds a certain threshold. If no second line appears it means you are either outside of the window or LH is too low to suggest ovulation. There are always low levels of LH in your body so a lighter or faint line just means you’re not ovulating yet. Using OPK test strips for several days before ovulation should show progressively darker test lines as your LH levels are on the rise and you approach ovulation. How to read the results from ovulation test strips You can read OPK test strips by the number and color of lines that appear on the test wand. Reading the results should be fairly simple if you followed the instructions of your particular kit carefully. Ovulation test strips that are positive will show a second line that is the same in color, or darker than the control line. A negative result will either show no test line, or the test line will appear fainter than the control line.  If no control line appears, consider the test invalid and use a new testing wand. Predicting ovulation Used correctly, most ovulation test strips are effective in detecting an LH surge, a sign that you are about to ovulate. If you start taking tests a few days prior to your anticipated ovulation, you can use the results to predict ovulation. As the LH surges, you should be able to see the result lines get progressively darker. Predicting fertility Ovulation strips can be an excellent tool to let you know when you are most fertile. Studies suggest they can detect ovulation up to 97 percent of the time and can help predict when you’re most likely to be fertile. Your most fertile days of the month are the 1-2 days before and after an egg is released from your ovaries. Start testing ovulation a few days before you are scheduled to ovulate, and you can use the results to predict your fertile window. Predicting pregnancy Using ovulation test strips doesn’t guarantee you’ll become pregnant, but they do play an important role in determining the time you are most likely to conceive.  Your best chance at becoming pregnant involves having intercourse during your fertile window, but by the time you see an LH surge, you are already in the middle of your window.        Use ovulation test strips before you are scheduled to ovulate to see how your levels of LH rise. This helps you know when you should have sex to get pregnant. How accurate are ovulation test strips? Used correctly, these tests are over 97 percent effective in detecting an LH surge. Because an LH surge is a surefire marker of ovulation for most women, using test strips to monitor the process is more precise than other methods. You can increase the effectiveness by combining them with other methods. How much should you expect to pay? Prices for ovulation test strips and ovulation predictor kits vary greatly based on factors like quantity, brand, and design. A basic box of strips will cost anywhere from $12 to $25 with most brands offering similar reliability. Digital readers cost slightly more, anywhere between $30-$50, but may be available for reimbursement through your healthcare insurance.  A digital fertility tracker, like Mira Fertility Analyzer, will have a higher initial investment than basic strips, but offers more personalized information such as hormone concentration in your urine, similar to results you would get at a doctor’s office. This information can then be used to track your cycle over time via the app to help you pinpoint your most fertile days. Ovulation test strips are an easy and accurate tool to help you pinpoint your LH surge and predict ovulation. While they are convenient for some, they may not be right for all women and you can talk with your doctor or healthcare provider to find the best option for you. Use ovulation test strips to time your best opportunity to conceive and increase your chances of getting pregnant.

With all the pressure placed on women to have a baby by a certain age, it can be easy to feel like your fertility is a ticking time bomb.  Thankfully, age does not necessarily limit your fertility as much as you may think. More and more women are choosing to wait until their 30s and 40s to have a child for reasons like pursuing career goals, traveling the world, or finding the right partner. Still, that does not mean that your fertility is an unlimited reserve. While it’s becoming more common — and, thanks to modern medical technology, safer — to have children at an older age, your fertility still changes significantly as you get older. Here’s what you need to know to understand your odds of pregnancy by age. Understanding Your Odds of Pregnancy by Age Our eggs age with us. When eggs age, they are more likely to become chromosomally abnormal. This means there are small mistakes in the DNA of the egg. Abnormal DNA can cause cells to function improperly — and, in the case of an egg, may mean that they are unable to become fertilized or mature into a healthy fetus. In your early 20s, 90% of your eggs are genetically normal. By your mid-40s, however, fewer than 20% of your eggs remain healthy. Knowing this information and how it affects your chances of pregnancy at different ages is important, but knowing what to do with it is even more important!  Getting Pregnant in Your 20s Many sources, including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, still believe that a woman’s best years to have a baby are her 20s. A healthy couple under 30 has approximately a 95% chance of getting pregnant after a year of having unprotected sex. Unless you have a health condition impacting fertility, such as endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), you can reasonably expect to get pregnant in your 20s with relative ease. Your risks of miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and genetic problems with your baby are also lowest in your 20s, given that you are overall healthy. Getting Pregnant in Your 30s Women between the ages of 30 and 35 still have a reasonably high chance of getting pregnant. However, your fertility has already begun to decline by the time you turn 30. After the age of 30, your chances of pregnancy decline by about 3% each year.        Most significantly, your fertility drops sharply after the age of 35. At age 37, you can expect to have just 25,000 eggs — 2.5% of your starting count. The risks of getting pregnant are also higher after age 35. By age 35, you are more likely to experience miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and genetic abnormalities of the fetus. For more information on getting pregnant in your 30s, check out our blog post here. Getting Pregnant in Your 40s You are significantly less likely to get pregnant in your 40s than in your 20s or early 30s. By age 40, your chances of getting pregnant are only 5% during each menstrual cycle, compared with 25% per cycle during your 20s. Your odds of miscarriage, pregnancy complications, and birth defects (such as Down syndrome) are also highest in your 40s. In your 40s, you may only have a few years if you want to get pregnant naturally. By age 45, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that getting pregnant naturally is unlikely for most women. After age 45, you will probably need to use assisted reproductive technology, such as in-vitro fertilization (IVF), to get pregnant. For more information on getting pregnant in your 40s, check out our blog post here. The Role of Age in Fertility Age plays an important role in fertility. Your chances of being able to get pregnant naturally start to lower slightly in your late 20s, and considerably in your late 30s. Once you hit 40, your chances of conceiving can drop to 5-10%. By the age of 45, the chance of pregnancy drops to less than 5%. These are statistics for the general population, but there’s always room for outliers. There are instances where a 24-year-old can be struggling to conceive, while older women approaching menopause can have an unexpected pregnancy. Risks It’s essential to understand how your age impacts your fertility when you are trying to conceive (TTC) or thinking about conceiving soon. Here are some of the ways in which your age may impact the risks of pregnancy. Miscarriage The risk of having a miscarriage in your 40s is nearly 50%, more than three times that of a woman in her 20s. The younger you are, the less likely you are to miscarry, given that you are otherwise healthy. That’s because the genetic mutations that cause most miscarriages become more common as women age. It’s estimated that half of all miscarriages are caused by extra or missing chromosomes.      Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Pregnancy Complications Certain complications in the mom or the baby become more common as women age. For example:   Preeclampsia is a syndrome combining high blood pressure with signs of kidney and liver damage during pregnancy. It is more common in mothers aged 40 and older. Premature birth (birth before 37 weeks gestation) frequently causes low birth weight, which can lead to complications in the health of the infant. Research suggests that women over age 40 are more likely to give birth prematurely. Some women develop high blood sugar during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes, which increases their risk of developing type II diabetes later in life. Compared with women ages 20 to 29, women in their 40s are three to six times more likely to develop gestational diabetes. Sometimes, pregnancies may implant outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tubes. These pregnancies are not viable due to growth restriction and can threaten the mother’s life if they cause the fallopian tubes to rupture. Women over 40 are at the highest risk of having an ectopic pregnancy when compared to women in other demographics.  Birth Defects Birth defects are most often caused by genetic abnormalities in the egg that becomes fertilized. As we stated previously, these genetic abnormalities become more common in a woman’s eggs as she gets older. The most common types of genetic abnormalities affect chromosomes. Normally, babies are born with two copies of each chromosome and when a baby is born with too many or too few chromosomes, they may develop health problems, such as learning disabilities or structural defects in the organs. Down Syndrome, caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (known as trisomy 21), is one of the most well-known genetic birth defects. Mothers over the age of 40 are significantly more likely to give birth to a baby with Down Syndrome. By the age of 40, your odds of giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome are 1 in 70; by age 45, the odds increase to 1 in 19. Treatments Your age — alongside other factors, such as your overall health and fertility — may affect whether or not you are able to get pregnant naturally. Whether you are in your 20s and looking to conserve your fertility or in your 30s or 40s trying to get pregnant with the help of assisted reproductive technology, here are some treatments to consider. Egg Freezing Medically-speaking, the optimal time to have a baby is in your early 20s. However, many women are not ready to conceive until much later in life. If you are approaching 35 and are not ready to have a baby, or have a progressive health condition that may impact your fertility as you age, you may consider freezing your eggs to be fertilized later on. Egg freezing can improve your odds of pregnancy later in life, but it is also an expensive, invasive procedure that may cause side effects. Your doctor can advise you if freezing your eggs may be the right decision for you. In-Vitro Fertilization Women who are struggling to get pregnant naturally may have success with in-vitro fertilization (IVF), either with their own eggs or with eggs from a donor. The process can be expensive and tiresome, but many women in their 30s and 40s have success with IVF. Furthermore, using donor eggs in IVF can improve your odds of pregnancy significantly if you are an older mother. That being said, many women prefer to try other methods before turning to IVF. The Mira fertility tracker may help you get pregnant naturally by helping you pinpoint the exact date of ovulation, through measuring your fertility hormone concentrations. Lifestyle Changes Every woman is born with a finite amount of eggs and as you age the quality and quantity of your eggs decrease, making it more difficult to get pregnant. Fortunately, a healthy lifestyle can help prevent some of the things that can impede pregnancy: obesity, underweight, stress, high blood pressure, and malnutrition. The key takeaway is that staying healthy maximizes your chance of a successful pregnancy, but won’t cancel out the effects of aging on the reproductive system. When to Get Help The process of TTC can feel exhausting and frustrating at times, no matter how old you are. However, most women do not need to worry if it takes them a while to get pregnant. Women who are under the age of 35 and have been trying for at least one year, or women older than 35 who have been trying for at least six months, should consult a fertility specialist for help getting pregnant. You should also talk to your doctor if you want to conceive but have a health condition that may impact your fertility, such as endometriosis or PCOS (read more about endometriosis and pregnancy here).

LH surge and ovulation About the LH surge How Mira can help you track your LH surge    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      If you are trying to conceive (TTC), you are probably already aware of the fact that you can only get pregnant during your fertile window. And within this fertile window, your chances of conceiving actually increase the closer you get to your ovulation day.  Making sure to have sex with your partner on these “peak” fertility days is key to planning a successful pregnancy. However, it does require a bit of planning and taking the time to understand how your hormones work throughout the ovulation process. To help, here is a closer look at the role of the luteinizing hormone (LH) in ovulation, how long after an LH surge you can expect to ovulate, and how Mira can help you to track your LH surge in order to more accurately predict ovulation. How long after an LH surge do you ovulate? For the majority of women who are considered healthy, ovulation typically occurs around 24 to 36 hours after the surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). Once ovulation is complete, LH levels then drop back to where they were prior to ovulation (read about early ovulation here). Typical baseline levels for LH range from 1.9 to 14.6 IU/L during the follicular phase and 0.7 to 12.9 IU/L during the luteal phase. However, during the LH surge and ovulation, LH can range from 12.2 IU/L all the way up to118.0 IU/L. For more information on LH levels and how they can vary, check out our recent article on LH levels here. LH surge and ovulation When does ovulation start after a positive ovulation test? Ovulation tests measure the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) present in your urine. If your ovulation test is positive, this indicates that your LH levels are high enough to be considered “surging”.  (More on increasing luteinizing hormone here.)        Once you receive a positive test (see what it looks like here), you can expect ovulation to take place within 24 to 36 hours. After ovulation, LH then decreases to its baseline. It’s important to note that ovulation timings can vary among women. Some women ovulate as early as day 8 of their cycle, while others ovulate as late as day 21. Many women believe they ovulate on day 14, however, this is considered the average and is not necessarily what happens every month. Finding the timing of your ovulation by simply logging your period on an app may not be enough to accurately determine your fertile window. Assuming you have a regular cycle, it could take more than one year of continuous logging to ensure that the calendar method becomes accurate for ovulation prediction. However, LH testing alongside using the calendar method is a great way to more accurately and efficiently pinpoint your fertile window and day of ovulation. How long am I fertile for after a positive ovulation test? After you have received a positive ovulation test, you are considered fertile for the following two to three days. This should encompass the day before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. Remember, sperm can live for up to five days within your body while an egg will only live for 12-24 hours after it is released through ovulation. Therefore, try to have sex with your partner as soon as possible after receiving a positive ovulation test as this is when your fertility is considered at its “peak”. When should we have sex if we’re TTC? If you are trying to conceive, you should be aware that you are only fertile for around six days during your cycle. This is called your “fertile window” and for the majority of women, it begins four to five days before ovulation and ends one day after ovulation. Therefore, the best time to have sex with your partner if you are trying to conceive is:  In the three to four days leading up to ovulation The day of ovulation and The day after ovulation  Having sex with your partner anytime during this window should give you the very best chances of conceiving, with your highest chances being the day right before ovulation and the day of ovulation. While it is not impossible to conceive outside of your fertile window, your chances of successful conception are low. About the LH surge The role of luteinizing hormone LH is a reproductive hormone that triggers the start of your most fertile days. Normally, LH levels remain fairly steady throughout the menstrual cycle. The exception is just before ovulation when LH levels surge dramatically. The time before ovulation is known as the follicular phase. During the follicular phase, follicles in the ovaries begin to mature, getting ready to release an egg. Eventually, one follicle emerges as the dominant follicle that will release its egg this menstrual cycle. The surge in LH triggers the release of the egg from the follicle, enabling ovulation. When you ovulate, the egg released by the dominant follicle travels down the fallopian tubes. If it is fertilized within 24 hours, it will travel further down and implant in the uterus to begin growing into a baby. If not, the egg dies and is shed, along with the uterine lining, during your menstrual period. Do you always ovulate after an LH surge? A surge in luteinizing hormone only indicates that you are likely to ovulate soon. And even though an LH surge is a good sign that ovulation will happen, there is still a small chance that an egg may not be released. This could be due to a number of different health and lifestyle factors that can vary for each individual. Because LH tests only predict when you are most likely to ovulate, you may want to supplement these tests with other testing and tracking methods for confirming ovulation. Here are three of the most common ways to do this.  Blood test at your doctor’s office. If a doctor is assisting you alongside your fertility journey, they may ask you to come in to take a blood test to confirm ovulation. Because heightened levels of progesterone are a sign of ovulation, this test will measure how much progesterone is present in your blood. Typically, this type of test can be taken around one week prior to when you are due for your next period. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Tracking. Another way to track and confirm ovulation is through basal body temperature (BBT) tracking. By taking your temperature each day at the same time, you may be able to identify a slight increase in temperature on the day that you ovulate. This method works best when used consistently over several cycles. Pregnanediol Glucuronide (PdG) Testing. When your body produces progesterone after ovulation, this progesterone is eventually metabolized and released through your urine as pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG). This means that if your progesterone levels are elevated, your PdG levels will be elevated as well. However, instead of needing to go to your doctor’s office for a blood test, you can instead use an at-home PdG test to determine whether or not your PdG levels are higher than normal. PdG is likely to be at its highest around six to eight days after ovulation, so this would be the best time to plan for a test.  How long does the LH surge last? On average, the entire LH surge lasts about two days. If you are trying to conceive, it’s important to pay attention to the length of your LH surge in relation to your ovulation day. This will allow you to plan sex with your partner on the days where you are at peak fertility. LH isn’t the only hormone that surges ahead of ovulation. Before ovulation, estrogen also surges and initiates the start of your fertile window. Within the next three days, LH surges and triggers ovulation as well as marks the start of your peak fertile days. After ovulation, your egg can live for up to 24 hours but beyond that, the chance of conceiving is zero. This is why your fertile window ends 24 hours after ovulation (more on how long ovulation lasts here). Some people advise using the basal body temperature (BBT) method over tracking your LH surge for pinpointing ovulation. However, BBT does not rise until 12 to 24 hours after ovulation, so you may miss your fertile window if you are using the BBT method alone to track ovulation. How to track your LH surge When it comes to tracking your LH levels and pinpointing your LH surge, there are a few different methods that you can try. Here is an overview of the top three. Blood test from a doctor’s office. This is the most accurate method for tracking LH. However, it does require you to visit the lab for every test. For people trying to conceive (TTC) or trying to avoid (TTA) pregnancy, it usually requires 10-15 tests per month, which could be inconvenient and expensive. You can reduce the number of tests slightly, but it increases the chance of missing ovulation as you may not ovulate on the exact same day every cycle. Given the expenses associated with frequent blood testing, this method is typically only recommended for those who are struggling to ovulate, finding it difficult to become pregnant, and/or those who are already undergoing fertility treatments with a doctor. Testing at home with an ovulation predictor kit (OPK). Another way that you can test and monitor your LH levels is with the help of ovulation predictor kits – also called “OPK’s”. These at-home test kits measure the concentration of LH in your urine, and they can give you insight into whether or not your LH levels are considered to be “surging”. If your result is positive, this means that you are considered above the hormone threshold for LH set by the OPK manufacturer, which is usually based on the population average. A negative result means you are below the population average. However, due to the fact that everyone’s hormone levels can vary, a positive or negative result may not necessarily mean that your LH levels are elevated compared to your own personal baseline levels. Additionally, for this method to work the best, you will also need to log your daily OPK results manually in a notebook or on your computer. While it’s not impossible to do, this extra step can be troublesome, stressful, and difficult to keep up with consistently. Using a smart hormone tracker. One of the best methods for tracking your LH levels is with an at-home smart hormone tracker like Mira. Together with the Mira app, you can see your actual LH concentrations with the accuracy of hospital-grade lab equipment. Mira works similar to an at-home pregnancy test, and it can measure your LH, estrogen, and other female hormone concentrations in your urine. This data is then automatically synced with the Mira app, which optimizes the ovulation prediction based on your personal health. It is accurate, easy to use, and adapts to your individual hormone patterns. How Mira can help you track your LH surge Mira empowers you to measure, monitor, and track hormone concentration levels in your body – specifically the fertility hormones LH and E3G. To do this, you need to have the Mira Analyzer, several Mira Fertility testing wands, and the Mira app downloaded onto your phone or tablet. To begin tracking for your LH surge specifically, all you need to do is start testing! Simply collect a urine sample in one of the provided cups, dip your test wand into the sample and leave it there for 10-12 seconds, and then insert the test wand directly into the Mira analyzer. The analyzer will provide you with a numeric value of your body’s exact levels of LH and E3G. This information will then be recorded and synced with the Mira app, allowing you to track your LH levels over the duration of your cycle.     Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Once you’ve taken several tests, you should be able to identify a spike in your levels of LH. For most women, this surge in LH is a sign that ovulation should occur within the next 24-36 hours. Together with your partner, you can use this information to plan intercourse on the days that you are the most fertile. For the majority of women, testing every day starting no later than the 6th day of your cycle should be sufficient for accurately predicting your LH surge. Testing daily may also be advantageous for beginners wanting to know more about their fertility cycle and those struggling with hormonal conditions such as PCOS.

What Are My Chances? Best Time to Have Sex FAQs    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      If you are planning a pregnancy in the near future, you have probably already read a lot about things like surging hormones, the biological processes behind ovulation, and ways to predict your fertile window.    However, at the end of the day, you can’t get pregnant without one thing: sex. And if your aim is to get pregnant as soon as possible, it’s important that you and your partner are not only having plenty of sex, but you are having plenty of sex at the right time of the menstrual cycle. To help you get started, here is everything you need to know about your fertile window, when to have sex after your LH surge, and when your chances of getting pregnant are at their highest. We’ll follow this up by answering some of the most frequently asked questions regarding sex, timing, and maximizing your chances of getting pregnant. Understand Your Fertile Window During your menstrual cycle, there are on average six days where you are the most likely to become pregnant if you have unprotected sex. This period of time is known as your “fertile window”, and it begins approximately four to five days before ovulation and ends 24 hours after ovulation. Within your fertile window, there are two days where you are considered at “peak” fertility. This includes the day before ovulation and the day of ovulation. For women trying to conceive (TTC), pinpointing these two most fertile days during the fertile window is key to planning a successful pregnancy. One way to do this is by tracking your luteinizing hormone (LH) levels as these levels spike or “surge” right before ovulation.        What is an LH surge? LH or the “luteinizing hormone” is simply a fertility hormone produced in the pituitary gland. Its main job is to stimulate the release of an egg from the ovary, while also stimulating the production of other reproductive hormones. In women, LH levels rise dramatically approximately 24-36 hours before ovulation. This increase or “surge” is what triggers the release of an egg from the ovary into the fallopian tube (also called ovulation) and marks the “peak” of your fertile window. Elevated LH levels also help to stimulate the corpus luteum to produce progesterone that helps support early pregnancy if conception occurs. Soon after ovulation happens, LH levels drop back to their baseline. Essentially, without a surge in the luteinizing hormone (LH), ovulation (and pregnancy) is not possible. When does ovulation start? Your exact day of ovulation will vary depending on the length of your cycle. However, no matter what day ovulation happens, your LH levels will surge beforehand. For the majority of women, this surge is brief, and you can expect to ovulate within 24-36 hours after the LH surge begins. However, some women may experience an LH surge of up to two to three days. It’s important to note here that every woman’s cycle is different. While some women ovulate on day 8 of their cycle, others ovulate as late as day 21 (more on late ovulation here). Monitoring and tracking your own personal LH levels is one of the best ways to pinpoint your exact day of ovulation and plan for pregnancy effectively.

You are most likely to conceive during the six days of your fertile window. For most women, this begins four to five days before ovulation and ends the day after ovulation (more on how long ovulation is here). This is because the lifespan of sperm is up to five days and the lifespan of an egg is 12-24 hours after it is released. Within this fertile window, your chances of becoming pregnant increase as you approach your ovulation day, with your highest chances on the days before and the day of ovulation. On the other days outside of your fertile window, your chances of conceiving are very low. That’s why it is so important to be aware of when your fertile window is, so that you can plan to have sex during this time. So, When Should You Have Sex? Having sex anytime during your fertile window is the best way to maximize your chances of conception. However, there are some days within your fertile window where your chances are the highest. Here’s a quick look at how to plan sex around your LH surge and a positive ovulation test. When should you have sex after your LH surge? Once you know that your LH levels are surging, you should aim to have sex with your partner at least once within the next two days. This is when you will be at your “peak” fertility. If possible, this should include the day before ovulation and the day of ovulation. When should you have sex after positive ovulation test? A positive ovulation test indicates that you are at the height of your fertile window and will ovulate within the next 24-36 hours. Therefore, if your ovulation test is positive, you should aim to have sex at least once within the next two days. Again, this should include the day before ovulation and the day of ovulation. What Are My Chances? Although sex anytime during your fertile window is good, there are certain days where your chances of conception are the highest. Here’s a look at what your chances are before, during, and after ovulation. Sex 2 days before ovulation At two days before ovulation, your LH levels will likely be on the cusp of surging. While you are not necessarily at peak fertility, your chances of conception are still higher on this day compared to the other days of your cycle. That’s because sperm can live up to five days in cervical mucus. So if you have sex two days prior to ovulation, there is still a very good chance that your partner’s sperm can fertilize your egg once ovulation occurs. Sex the day before ovulation Your chances of conception are at their highest on the day before ovulation, and having sex on this day is highly recommended if you are trying to become pregnant. According to a certified nurse-midwife, the majority of pregnancies “result from sex that happened less than two days before ovulation”, so try to pencil in sex on this day if you can. Sex during ovulation Your chances of getting pregnant are also very high the day that you ovulate. On this day, your egg will be released and your cervical mucus will be the right texture to facilitate conception. If you and your partner have not had sex yet, make sure to do so on your day of ovulation as this is the last day within your fertile window where your fertility is at its “peak”. Sex after ovulation The day after ovulation is still considered one of your most fertile days of the month. However, it’s important to note that once your eggs have been released, they will only live for up to 24 hours. After that, your chances of conception will drastically decrease. Therefore, if you are trying to conceive, make sure to have sex no later than the day after ovulation. Best Time to Have Sex FAQs If you are setting out on your fertility journey, you will no doubt have a few questions about the best times to have sex in order to get pregnant. You may even be wondering if timing actually matters at all! To help, here are a few of your most frequently asked questions answered.    Does timing really matter?  Yes! It absolutely does! Although it’s not impossible, it is rare to become pregnant during the days outside of your fertile window. Here’s why. Why timing mattersPregnancy happens when an egg is fertilized by a sperm. During a woman’s menstrual cycle, eggs are released from the ovary during ovulation and once released, they can only live for up to 24 hours. Therefore, in order to make sure that your partner’s sperm reaches your egg in time, it’s important to have sex around the time of your menstrual cycle where you are ovulating. In addition to your egg being released, your cervical mucus also changes in the days leading up to ovulation and during ovulation. Before ovulation, it may feel stickier than usual, and around ovulation it will likely feel slippery and stretchy – similar to the consistency of raw egg whites. This texture is designed to help your partner’s sperm (which can live for up to five days inside of your body) make the long journey through your vagina to the uterus in order to fertilize your egg. This is why you are still considered at peak fertility in the days leading up to ovulation – because even if you have not ovulated yet, your partner’s sperm can still be living inside of you at your time of ovulation. Monitoring your cycle and predicting ovulationNow that we’ve settled the fact that timing is everything when it comes to getting pregnant, you might be on the lookout for ways to accurately predict your fertility window and day of ovulation. To help, here are a few different ovulation prediction methods that you can try and test for yourself. Calendar Method: This method involves keeping track of your menstrual cycle daily over the course of six months to a year. With diligent tracking, you can get a good estimate of when your most fertile days of the month are. Alongside tracking your period, you can also track the consistency of your cervical mucus. Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method: Your temperature rises approximately 0.5°F 12 hours after you ovulate. Therefore, your most fertile days will be two days prior to this rise in BBT. By tracking your BBT daily over the course of 6-12 months, you can anticipate when ovulation will occur, aim to have sex on your most fertile days, and confirm that ovulation has happened. This method works great in combination with the calendar method. Hormone Testing: At-home hormone testing is one of the most accurate ways to predict your fertility window and day of ovulation. In fact, one study found that women who use at-home ovulation tests correctly have an increased likelihood of pregnancy. There is not a “one size fits all” solution for fertility tracking. The best way to get started is to simply listen to your body, stay mindful of your cycle, and be open to trying fertility tracking methods.    How long am I fertile after a positive OPK?  Once you test positive for ovulation, you are considered at peak fertility for the following two to three days. During this time you will have ovulated and your egg will be viable for the following 24 hours. If conception is your goal, try to have sex with your partner a few times during this period to maximize your chances of getting pregnant. Even though you can still technically get pregnant anytime during the month, your highest chances of conceiving will be in these two to three days following your positive OPK test.    Should I have as much sex as possible if I’m TTC?  On average, having unprotected sex every two to three days throughout your entire cycle should eventually result in a successful pregnancy. According to the pregnancy research charity, Tommy’s, it is estimated that “8 out of 10 couples where the woman is under 40 years old will get pregnant within one year if they have regular, unprotected sex”. However, if you find that having sex every two to three days is just too much for you and your partner, penciling in sex around your time of ovulation is a great way to ensure that you are having sex at the right time of the month. This way, you do not feel pressured to have sex as often, but when you do, your chances of getting pregnant are at their highest. It is also important to note that having sex with your partner should not stress you out or feel like a chore. Remember, stress can hinder your chances of getting pregnant, so don’t let sex become a point of tension between you and your partner. Instead, try to work out ways that you can make sex for conception as enjoyable as possible. If you enjoy it, you will be likely to have it more frequently. Ways that you can do this include making sex with your partner a priority, exploring different positions, and reducing your overall lifestyle stress.

Other ways to track your cycle  Where to start with BBT when it comes to ovulation     Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      The basal body temperature (BBT) method is a natural fertility planning method that can be used by women who are trying to conceive (TTC) and trying to avoid (TTA) pregnancy to predict ovulation. The method has been around a long time — since the 1930s, in fact — so there is a lot of evidence behind how basal body temperature and ovulation work together. However, the BBT method relies on accuracy, and beginners often make mistakes when using it for the first time. Learning how to use basal body temperature to determine ovulation is important for an accurate estimate of your fertile method. Read on for helpful tips and facts you should know before trying it at home.    What is basal body temperature?  Your basal body temperature (BBT) measures your body temperature when you are completely at rest. There is a slight rise in BBT after ovulation, usually up to one degree Fahrenheit. Women can use this increase in BBT to predict when they are most fertile, to either conceive or avoid sex during that time. Before ovulation, a woman’s average BBT is between 97 and 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius). After ovulation, a woman’s average BBT is between 97.6 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit(between 36.4 & 37 degrees Celsius). This BBT chart shows how a woman’s BBT can change after ovulation:    As you can see, the shift in BBT after ovulation is very subtle — in fact, BBT may change by as little as 0.1 degrees Fahrenheit! A common mistake that beginners make with the BBT method is confusing BBT with regular body temperature. However, unlike regular body temperature, BBT can only be measured first thing in the morning, before you have gotten out of bed, using a special thermometer. BBT thermometers measure temperature in tenths of a degree, allowing women to track very slight changes in their body temperature. BBT must be measured first thing in the morning because even small movements — like walking from your bed to the bathroom to brush your teeth — can cause slight increases in body temperature. Thus, for the most accurate results, you should take your BBT when still lying in bed at the same time every morning. Many women find it helpful to keep the BBT thermometer next to their bed at night to remind them to take their temperature as soon as they wake up the next morning. Basal body temperature and ovulation Before ovulation, there is a surge in a reproductive hormone called luteinizing hormone, or LH. This LH surge triggers the release of an egg by the ovary, a.k.a. Ovulation.  The LH surge triggers ovulation and if ovulation happens then progesterone levels rapidly rise, along with BBT.  These hormonal changes can be monitored at-home with a hormone monitor like the Mira Max Kit.   Changes in BBT become most noticeable in the days following ovulation. The increase in temperature after ovulation lasts 12 to 14 days in a part of the menstrual cycle known as the luteal phase. It’s important to note that your most fertile days take place two to three days before your BBT rises. So, BBT can confirm that your ovulation has occurred, but it does not predict when you will ovulate. This limits its accuracy for preventing pregnancy but does help you track and monitor ovulation if you’re TTC. How to track your BBT to estimate ovulation  Tracking your ovulation by temperature requires advance preparation. The BBT method requires you to buy a special BBT thermometer and measure your temperature every day before you get out of bed in the morning and at the same time every day. You will also need to select a type of BBT chart to record changes in your BBT over time. Some women track their BBT with an app while others prefer to use graph paper.  Even easier is a BBT thermometer that automatically syncs with an app, like the Mira BBT thermometer does, taking the guesswork out of manual logging and chart monitoring.  To track your basal body temperature, you’ll need to:  Take your temperature every morning. It should be taken at the same time each day. Take your temperature before rising out of bed. Use a BBT thermometer orally.  Check your temperature using your basal body temperature chart. Repeat the process for at least three cycles.  Choosing a BBT chart Choosing a chart to track your ovulation body temperature while using the basal body temperature method doesn’t have to be complicated.  You can find examples in fertility books or use a fertility calendar.  Most people choose a digital chart or app, but you can also do it the old fashioned way and create your own paper graph to track your ovulation temperature.  If you decide to make your own graph it’s as easy as plotting the temperature on the vertical axis (allowing one-tenth of a degree for each square) and the days of your cycle along the horizontal axis.   Digital solutions like online fertility calendars and fertility apps are popular because they not only reduce the chance of human error, but can help you log other information to pinpoint ovulation.  The simplest way to chart BBT is with a thermometer that automatically syncs data with an app.  Mira has a comprehensive app that can be used with or without our fertility device to help you understand your body’s natural fertility symptoms and our BBT thermometer syncs perfectly.  Rather than charting on your own, or entering data, you can just check the chart on the app.          Common Issues with BBT Tracking Although BBT chart ovulation tracking is relatively simple and inexpensive, there are some common issues that can derail your efforts.  The relationship between BBT and ovulation can take months of tracking before you can successfully predict ovulation and research has shown that it can be somewhat unreliable.  This is mainly due to the fact that BBT confirms when ovulation has already happened, rather than giving you the heads up that ovulation is about to happen.  If you don’t want to wait on the months it can take to actually predict ovulation with the BBT method (and only if your cycle is regular), it’s better to rely on hormone monitoring.   Tracking your ovulation temperature can be influenced by many factors including how much sleep you get, timing consistency, using electric blankets, drinking alcohol, and waking up to use the bathroom before you check your temperature.  For most, the burdens of accurately tracking your basal body temperature can be too much and there are plenty of other options.  It’s not unhelpful to track your ovulation body temperature, but when combined with something like Mira’s hormone monitor, you can be sure of the accuracy and unlock new insights about your unique cycle patterns. Last but not least, the basal body temperature method requires a specialized thermometer to accurately read the temperature fluctuations.  A regularl thermometer is not accurate enough to read the tiny differences in temperature.  You’ll need the right tool for the job, like Mira’s basal body thermometer to accurately capture those details.             Mira BBT thermometer Track your cycle naturally. Chart your results automatically. Buy now    Factors that may impact BBT accuracy  Your basal body temperature can be influenced by a number of factors, directly impacting the accuracy of this method.  The most obvious factors are interrupted sleep cycles or not taking your temperature at the same time every single day.  Other factors include illness or fever, stress levels, alcohol, travel, certain medications, and shift work.   Dealing with irregular cycles  Having an irregular cycle can make it difficult to get an accurate estimate of ovulation.  You may need to rely on additional measures to determine when you ovulate like tracking the consistency of your cervical mucus alongside your basal body temperature. The best way to know for sure if you are ovulating is through hormone tracking and testing.  Digital fertility trackers like Mira can determine the exact numerical value of your hormones to predict when you will ovulate with scientific precision.  With this method, you can determine when you are ovulating, even if your ovulation is irregular.       Addressing temperature fluctuations Your basal body temperature fluctuates daily but for some people it fluctuates more than others.  Sometimes these fluctuations can be addressed by re-assessing your measuring routine and adjusting as necessary.  Even small changes, like thermometer placement, can have a big impact on your measurements.   Changes in your routine can have the biggest impact on seemingly unstable temperature variations. The biggest culprits are sleep disturbances like getting less sleep than normal, a partner, child, or pet waking you up, being hungover, or getting out of bed before measuring.  Checking your graph often can help you understand what personal factors are impacting your temperature readings and how you can possibly reduce fluctuations.      In doubt about your BBT values?

The BBT method is popular for a reason: it can reliably confirm when ovulation has taken place, as long as you use it accurately and consistently. Forgetting to take or chart your BBT for just one day could cause you to miss your ovulation. This could result in an unplanned pregnancy if you are TTA. However, BBT is only an estimate, and it cannot predict ovulation before it has occurred. To predict ovulation before it happens, you’ll need to track your levels of LH before and after ovulation to observe when an LH surge takes place. Without tracking your LH levels and other hormones, you will only be able to estimate when you are going to ovulate next. This can be problematic because there is sometimes a great variation between ovulation days during different cycles, even in the same woman! As a result, you might get pregnant, even though you are TTA. There are lots of studies on the pros and cons of the BBT method:  A study among six physicians recorded basal body temperatures of three women. Out of their collective charting, the accuracy rate was 38.1%. One study of an app used to track BBT for pregnancy prevention found a typical-use failure rate of 8.3%, making it more effective than other fertility awareness methods. In another study with 30 women, BBT charting had a failure rate of 20% when estimating ovulation. In 2005, a medical review article concluded BBT was not an accurate method for predicting ovulation. New evidence suggests that wearable technology measuring wrist skin temperature may improve the accuracy of the BBT method.  There are even more factors that can cause the BBT method to fail. For example:  You may not have time for consistent daily tracking. Having a fever will make tracking inaccurate. Being emotionally or physically stressed can raise your body temperature. Consuming alcohol, drugs, and prescription medication can cause temperature changes. Women do not always have consistent increases and decreases in BBT. Women have unique menstrual cycles that may make charting difficult.  These factors show that BBT can be a difficult method to follow and use consistently. A BBT chart is not always the best or most reliable way to predict ovulation to conceive or avoid pregnancy. However, it can be helpful, especially in combination with other tracking methods, like using a digital fertility tracker. Other ways to track your cycle  There are many other natural fertility planning methods you can use with or without the BBT method to prevent or plan for pregnancy:   Ovulation calculators. Ovulation calculators give a simple estimate of when you ovulate based on the length of your cycle in calendar days. The formula used is to calculate the date of ovulation is (day of your next period – 14 days = ovulation day). The formula used to calculate your fertile window is (day of ovulation – 4 days = start of your fertile window). However, ovulation calculators are flawed because every woman’s cycle is different, and ovulation days may vary from month to month. Cervical mucus method. Many women use the cervical mucus method alongside the BBT method to track their fertility. Cervical mucus is the slight discharge you may notice in your panties when you are feeling normal and healthy. Throughout most of the month, your cervical mucus is thick, creamy, and white or off-white in color. When a woman is most fertile, however, the cervical mucus becomes clear and stretchy, like an egg white. You can collect and observe the changes in your cervical mucus using a finger, a piece of toilet tissue, or a pantyliner, but because many things can affect your cervical mucus besides fertility — such as infections and sexual activity — you may want to refrain from relying solely on the cervical mucus method.  Ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). OPKs are drugstore tests you can purchase that will give you a positive or negative result to tell you if you are currently ovulating. They work the same way an at-home pregnancy test does, by measuring hormone concentrations in your urine. OPKs measure your LH levels and compare them to a threshold drawn from population averages to let you know if you are ovulating. The best test kits are 99% accurate, but sometimes give false negatives or false positives if your unique hormone levels differ from the population average. You must also test frequently to get the most reliable results, which can get expensive over time.  Digital fertility trackers. Digital fertility trackers like Mira improved upon OPKs by measuring LH levels in your urine with laboratory-grade accuracy. Because it relies on artificial intelligence to make smart predictions about your cycle, Mira can detect ovulation even when your LH surge is small or when you have many smaller surges in LH throughout your cycle (which is often due to a hormonal condition like polycystic ovarian syndrome). Mira also learns when you do and don’t need to test and will send you reminders, saving you money on ovulation test strips and making sure you don’t forget to track your hormones.  Where to start with BBT when it comes to ovulation  When used consistently and correctly, the BBT method is one of the more accurate fertility awareness methods (FAMs) for preventing and planning pregnancy. However, like all FAMs, the BBT method is most accurate when used in conjunction with other tracking methods. Using BBT along with other metrics to predict ovulation is known as the symptothermal method. Combining the BBT method with other data like cervical mucus changes or fertility hormone concentrations can help you get pregnant faster or avoid pregnancy more reliably than using BBT alone.

What to expect from your discharge Cervical mucus monitoring 101 Cervical mucus FAQs    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       Cervical mucus is one of the key biological indicators of ovulation, and taking note of how it changes throughout each stage of your menstrual cycle can be a great tool for family planning. In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about your cervical mucus including how it changes, how to track it, and its relevance for couples who are TTC or TTA.  What is cervical mucus? Cervical mucus is a type of fluid secreted by the cervix, commonly referred to as “discharge”. Due to fluctuating hormone levels, the texture, consistency, and volume of cervical mucus changes throughout a woman’s menstrual cycle.  Around ovulation, it is common for cervical mucus to increase in volume, while also having the distinct look and feel of raw egg whites. This is why many women who are TTC keep track of their changes in cervical mucus, as it enables them to naturally predict ovulation.  What to expect from your discharge Discharge before your period Before your period, discharge is typically white or milky white in color. Often referred to as leukorrhea, this type of discharge can have a cloudy appearance and feel sticky to the touch. In terms of volume, it will be much lower compared to the time around ovulation, and some days you may not experience any discharge at all.  Discharge after your period In the days immediately following your period, you are not likely to experience any discharge. If you do, it may be white in color and light in volume – similar to the type of discharge commonly found before your period.  Discharge before ovulation In the 4-5 days leading up to ovulation, you may notice that your body produces more discharge. During this time, it’s common for discharge to appear yellow, white, or cloudy white in color. It may also feel stickier than normal. This type of discharge is a sign that a developing egg in your ovaries is ripening and preparing for release through ovulation.  Discharge during ovulation Your body will release the most discharge right before ovulation and during ovulation. This type of discharge is stretchy, slippery, and clear – hence why many often describe it as having the texture of raw egg whites. During this time, discharge is designed to help facilitate pregnancy by protecting sperm and helping it reach the egg for fertilization.  Discharge after ovulation When ovulation is over, it’s normal for discharge to be much lighter in volume compared to during ovulation. You may also notice that it becomes gradually cloudier and stickier, before stopping altogether for a few days. Before you know it, it will be time for your period and the cycle will start again!   Discharge if you’re pregnant In general, it is common to experience more discharge during pregnancy. This is due in large part to fluctuating hormones – particularly increasing estrogen levels. Some women do experience an increase in discharge or “leukorrhea” within the first two weeks of conception. However, this symptom alone isn’t always an early sign of pregnancy.  As discharge gradually increases throughout pregnancy, it also helps to build up the mucus plug. A mucus plug is simply a collection of mucus that helps to protect the uterus (and developing baby) from unwanted infection. The mucus plug is eventually released through the vagina prior to labor, and when this occurs, it can have the appearance of heavy discharge.  It’s also important to mention that some women do experience implantation bleeding in the very early days of pregnancy. This discharge can look like brown or pink spotting, and many women may mistake it for their period. An estimated 30% of women also experience implantation cramping during this time alongside spotting. Cervical mucus monitoring 101 Should you track your vaginal discharge? Whether you are TTC or TTA, it doesn’t hurt to have a general awareness of what your vaginal discharge is telling you. For example, gray, yellow, or green discharge may be a sign of infection, while clear, stretchy discharge may be a sign that you are fertile.  While you may not need to track your discharge every single day (unless you are actively trying to predict ovulation when TTC or TTA), it’s still beneficial to know what your discharge means so that you can make good choices for your personal health.   How to monitor your cervical mucus There are several research-backed methods for monitoring your cervical mucus throughout your cycle. Here’s a brief overview of three of the most common methods including the Creighton Method, the Billings Ovulation Method, and the 2-Day Method.   Creighton Method The Creighton Method (sometimes abbreviated to ‘CrMS’) was developed off the back of 30 years of scientific research. When following this model, women are taught by a certified Creighton Model consultant how to observe, track, and chart their cervical mucus throughout their cycle. The consultant can then use this information to provide advice on fertility and/or reproductive health issues.  For those who are TTA, the Creighton Model is 98.7-99.5% effective at preventing pregnancy with perfect use and 83-97% effective with typical use. This is similar to the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. For those who are TTC, the Creighton Model can also be helpful. In fact, one study of 50 couples found that 49 (98%) became pregnant within six cycles of using the Creighton Method, with 28 (76%) of pregnancies occurring in the first cycle.    Billings Ovulation Method The Billings Ovulation Method is similar to the Creighton Method in that it only tracks cervical mucus and it requires an instructor.  However, unlike the Creighton Method which requires physical touching and finger testing of cervical mucus, the Billings Ovulation Method encourages women to focus more on the “sensation” of the mucus at the vagina and how it feels. For example, feelings of dryness, wetness, and slipperiness are all sensations that women are encouraged to record when following this method.  For those who are TTA, the Billings Ovulation Method is 98.9% effective at preventing pregnancy with perfect use and 89.5% effective with typical use.   The Billings Method is also helpful for those TTC, with one study finding that 62.5% of couples achieved pregnancy within 2 years after following the Billings Method.   2-Day Method Another way to monitor cervical mucus is by following the 2-Day Method. Unlike the Creighton Method or the Billings Ovulation Method, the 2-Day Method does not require you to observe and record specific features of your cervical mucus. Instead, all you have to keep track of is whether or not you have had any cervical mucus at all.  At the end of each day, you must ask yourself two questions:  Did I have any cervical mucus today? Did I have any cervical mucus yesterday?   If you answer yes to one or both of those questions, then you are considered fertile and your chances of pregnancy are high. If you answer no to both questions, then you are not considered fertile and your chances of pregnancy are much lower.  According to research, the 2-Day Method is approximately 96% effective at preventing pregnancy when followed correctly and 86% effective with typical use.  Cervical mucus FAQs    What does cervical mucus do?  Cervical mucus plays a key role in helping couples become pregnant. In fact, it has three key functions including: *Admitting the sperm into the vagina. *Filtering out abnormal sperm.*Nurturing and supporting sperm as it prepares for fertilization.    Is there a bad type of discharge?  Yes. There are certain types of discharge that may indicate an underlying problem.  For example, gray discharge is a key sign of bacterial vaginosis (also known as BV). Alternatively, yellow or green discharge can be a sign of trichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Even though white discharge is considered normal, if it appears in large amounts, this could be an indicator of a yeast infection (also known as Vaginal Candidiasis).  In addition to the color and quantity of discharge, it’s also important to be mindful of other symptoms commonly associated with infection. This includes: *Low abdomen or pelvic pain*Itching, burning, and/or redness around the vagina*Foul-smelling odor*Painful urination*Fever and chills If you are experiencing any of the above symptoms alongside yellow, green, or gray discharge, you should speak with your doctor immediately as this could be a sign of a serious infection or STI. Your doctor can then further assess your situation and offer appropriate treatment.    Can cervical mucus determine if you’re pregnant?  Even though many women do experience light spotting or a slight increase in discharge in the very early days of their pregnancy, this symptom alone is not enough to confirm pregnancy.  Instead, The American Pregnancy Association lists the following as the most common early signs that you are pregnant: *Missed period*Breast tenderness*Nausea and/or vomiting*Increased need to urinate*Sleepiness and fatigue The earliest you can take a pregnancy test is at least one day after your estimated missed period. Even though this wait can feel like forever, this is the best way to avoid the frustration and disappointment that comes with false-negative and false-positive results.                 Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

What is an irregular period and how common are they? How to get pregnant with irregular periods   What causes irregular periods? Ovulation and irregular periods FAQs about irregular periods and pregnancy    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      When your periods are irregular, trying to conceive (TTC) can be challenging.  Women with regular periods are four times more likely to conceive than women with irregular periods.  Fortunately, that doesn’t mean that natural conception isn’t possible and many women with irregular cycles go on to have healthy pregnancies despite an irregular period.   In this post you’ll learn how to get pregnant fast and manage the challenges presented by an irregular period, including tracking ovulation, timing intercourse, and other potential health complications.     Can you get pregnant with irregular periods? Yes! Getting pregnant is related to ovulation and as long as you are ovulating (even irregularly) you should be able to get pregnant.  Irregular periods don’t necessarily mean the absence of ovulation, they just mean you are not ovulating on a regular or predictable schedule.   While this may make things more difficult than it would be for someone with regular cycles, it doesn’t make it impossible.  Sometimes it can be as simple as making lifestyle changes to regulate your period or may be as involved as fertility treatments.  Regardless of what helps you conceive, irregular periods do not spell the end of your pregnancy hopes. What is an irregular period and how common are they? Women are often told that the average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days, but in reality this is an outdated number based on averages.  What counts as a normal period varies widely from woman to woman.  A normal period may occur every 21 days to 35 days and typically lasts two to seven days. An irregular period is defined as one or more of the following:  A menstrual cycle lasting fewer than 21 days or more than 35 days A period that lasts fewer than two days or longer than eight days Cycles that vary in length by more than seven to nine days (for example, 24 days one cycle and 42 days the next)  Having fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year- also known as oligomenorrhea   Going 90+ days without a menstrual period with no medical explanation (i.e. pregnancy, hormonal contraception, or menopause) – also known as amenorrhea   Irregular periods can also be characterized by abnormal menstrual bleeding, and was previously referred to as menorrhagia. Symptoms of menorrhagia include:  Soaking through one or more pads or tampons every hour for several consecutive hours  Filling a menstrual cup every 2-3 hours  Needing to “double-up” on menstrual pads or waking up in the middle of the night to change your pad Passing blood clots larger than the size of a quarter Menstrual periods lasting longer than 7 days Heavy menstrual flow that keeps you from doing things you would normally do Symptoms of anemia such as tiredness, dizziness, or shortness of breath  Cycle length by itself doesn’t determine irregular periods and you may have one or more signs that your periods are irregular.  These signs can also change month to month for many women.   How to get pregnant with irregular periods Irregular periods don’t spell the end of your natural pregnancy hopes.  While some women with irregular periods will need to use fertility treatments, many take steps to get pregnant on their own through lifestyle changes or even tracking ovulation.  Make healthy lifestyle changes Improving your overall health before pregnancy is important for everyone, but it’s even more crucial for women with irregular periods.  These are some yet effective lifestyle changes you can make:  Quit smoking cigarettes Quit consuming alcohol Eat a healthy, balanced diet  Get light to moderate exercise Avoid excessive dieting or exercise Take a daily multivitamin  Take folic acid and Coq10 supplements   These changes are affordable, good for your overall well-being, and may help you conceive. Track your ovulation closely There are numerous ways to estimate ovulation but irregular periods make it difficult to get accurate estimates.  Irregular cycles often cause issues using traditional methods like the basal body temperature method, checking cervical mucus, or the calendar method.  Ovulation predictor kits (OPK) can also be faulty for women with irregular periods and tracking your period alone will not tell you if you’ve ovulated or not.  Using Mira’s fertility prediction kit is a more effective way to determine your fertile window.  Your daily levels of actual hormone concentrations are measured (with 99% accuracy) to detect when ovulation does (or does not) occur.  Increase frequency of intercourse It’s common for women to focus on conceiving during their two peak fertility days, but having sex more often can improve your chances of getting pregnant.   To get pregnant fast with irregular periods, have intercourse frequently during your five-to-six-day fertile window.  Increasing the frequency of sex can boost your chances of conception. Reduce stress and anxiety Stress triggers hormonal imbalances and studies show that even short-term stress and anxiety can cause irregular and missed periods.  Reduce stress or anxiety by:   Learning stress management techniques such as deep breathing or meditation  Exercising regularly to increase endorphins Getting consistent amounts of sleep Seeking support through counseling or support groups    What causes irregular periods? Medical conditions and health issues are the leading causes of irregular menstrual cycles.  Some require treatment, but others may resolve on their own.  Below are common conditions linked to irregular periods. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition caused by hormonal imbalance that often interferes with menstruation cycles and as a result, cycle regularity.  Hormonal imbalances can cause problems in the ovaries when the egg may not develop as it should or may not be released during ovulation as it should.   You may still be able to conceive with PCOS.  Medication is sometimes prescribed to help with ovulation and you’ll likely need to see a fertility specialist for monitoring.       Uterine fibroids Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths that can appear during childbearing years.  They are fairly common.  Some women have no symptoms while others may experience heavy menstrual bleeding, longer than normal bleeding, pelvic pain, and lower back pain.   The exact cause of fibroids is unknown but genetics and hormones may play a role.  Most types of uterine fibroids don’t affect fertility and pregnancy – except submucosal fibroids.   Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that occurs when bacteria in the vagina spreads to the female reproductive organs through the cervix.  It is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections.   Symptoms can range from non-existent or mild to severe.  Common symptoms of PID include:  abnormal bleeding or discharge painful intercourse fatigue pelvic pain fever  PID is usually treated with antibiotics but may cause infertility if not addressed.  If you have unprotected sex or multiple partners, get tested for STIs regularly to ensure you receive prompt treatment. Weight-related health problems Weight can cause irregular periods in many ways.  Being either overweight, or underweight can impact your fertility by causing ovulation disruptions and making it harder to get pregnant.   Eating disorders, excessive exercise, and excessive weight loss can all cause irregular cycles. Maintaining a healthy weight helps regulate hormonal balance and you can use an ideal weight calculator to find your target weight range.  This can help you set weight loss or weight gain goals for pregnancy.   Ovulation and irregular periods Ovulation plays an important role in fertility and irregular ovulation is the most common cause of infertility.  Irregular periods can signify that you are not ovulating regularly or having anovulatory cycles (cycles where you do not ovulate at all), leading to varying lengths in menstrual cycles.     Ovulation symptoms for irregular periods An understanding of the signs and symptoms can help you pinpoint ovulation even with irregular periods.  Both your cervical mucus and basal body temperature change throughout your cycle and those changes can help you determine when you ovulate:   Cervical mucus becomes stretchy and clear, like the consistency of an eggwhite  Basal body temperature (BBT) also fluctuates with the onset of ovulation and tracking this spike lets you know that ovulation is occurring  How to track ovulation with irregular periods The best way to know for sure if you are ovulating is through hormone tracking and testing.  Digital fertility trackers like Mira can determine the exact numerical value of LH and FSH in your urine to predict when you will ovulate with scientific precision.  If you can spot the LH and FSH surges in your hormone patterns, you can determine when you are ovulating, even if your ovulation is irregular.     FAQs about irregular periods and pregnancy We’ve done our best to answer some of your most common questions about irregular periods and pregnancy.      When do I ovulate with irregular periods?  Every woman is different and her cycle (and ovulation) will be different as well.  While hard to predict, you can always confirm ovulation through hormone testing and tracking.      How hard is it to get pregnant if I have irregular periods?  Women with regular periods are four times more likely to conceive than women with irregular periods.  However, irregular periods don’t automatically mean infertility and with consistent tracking and timed intercourse it’s still very much possible to get pregnant.

Common Ovulation Symptoms Tracking Ovulation Ovulation and Fertility: What You Need to Know Ovulation Complications and Solutions Final thoughts Ovulation FAQs    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         Ovulation is an important milestone in your menstrual cycle and an important indicator of fertility.  It’s the process by which an egg is released from an ovary and is ready to be fertilized.  Keeping track of the timing of ovulation can help you plan a pregnancy or avoid one as well.  In this article, we’ll be focusing on the process of ovulation, how it works, and when it occurs. We’ll also shed light on some of the most common ovulation symptoms, how you can keep track of when you ovulate, and how to use this information whether you’re planning a pregnancy or planning to avoid one.   Key Takeaways Every menstrual cycle has two milestones: a period and ovulation.  Understanding ovulation and the process behind it can be an important factor in understanding your fertility.  Traditional methods of tracking involve paying attention to common ovulation symptoms.  Signs like changes in your basal body temperature, changes in cervical mucus, and mood changes can all be used as predictors that ovulation is about to take place or has already occurred.   Regardless of when you ovulate, your sex hormones follow a predictable path before ovulation.  Your hormone levels are one of the most accurate and fundamental ovulation symptoms that you can track.  Even if you are not trying to conceive, hormone testing can help you understand other aspects of your reproductive health.    What is Ovulation? Ovulation is a reoccuring event of your menstrual cycles where an egg is released from the ovaries.  Your cycle can be broken up into two phases: the follicular phase and the luteal phase.   At the beginning of the follicular phase, the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) rises.  This hormone helps to develop an ovarian follicles, one of which will eventually house an egg.  FSH also helps to stimulate the production of estrogen, which supports the further development of the follicle and egg, while also thickening the uterine lining.        Next, as the follicle develops luteinizing hormone (LH) surges and triggers the body to ovulate.  The whole process of ovulation involves the egg being released from the follicle. Then the egg travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. After its release, the egg has between 12-24 hours to be fertilized by a sperm. If it is not fertilized, it disintegrates and is shed alongside the uterine lining during the menstrual period.  If the egg is fertilized, it may result in pregnancy.   You are considered at “peak” fertility in the days leading up to ovulation as LH surges and on the day of ovulation since these are the days you are most likely to get pregnant. This period of time is known as your fertile window are 5 days before ovulation ( the lifespan of sperm) and one day as ovulation happened(the lifespan of egg)   Common Ovulation Symptoms There are a number of common signs and symptoms that may occur during ovulation.  Not everyone experiences them and they can change from month to month.  The most common ovulation symptoms include: Light cramps One in five people experience light cramping or pain around the time of ovulation.  Ovulation pain is commonly referred to as “mittelschmerz” from the German words for “middle” and “pain”.  This pain can occur around ovulation and often feels like sharp pain or pressure in the lower abdomen.   Changes in cervical mucus You may notice your discharge resembles the look and texture of raw egg whites around the time of ovulation.  It’s common for your cervical mucus to change around the time of ovulation due to fluctuating hormone levels.  It may increase in volume along with changes in texture and consistency.   Breast tenderness Some people may experience changes in their breast tissue during ovulation.  Breast tenderness or sore nipples are often reported as ovulation symptoms.   Libido changes It’s common to experience an increase in libido around the time of ovulation. This is simply nature’s way of saying that it’s the right time to try to conceive.   Mood swings Any time there are hormonal changes, you may be at risk of experiencing mood swings.  Fluctuations in estrogen, luteinizing hormone, and progesterone can all lead to mood swings and you may experience a variety of emotional states like sadness, sensitivity, restlessness, or a surge in energy.              Tracking Ovulation Whether you are trying to get pregnant or trying to avoid getting pregnant, it can be useful to track ovulation.  As one of the key milestones of your menstrual cycle, tracking ovulation patterns can be especially beneficial for family planning or getting to know more about your reproductive health.  There are several different methods you can use to track ovulation.  Each comes with their own set of pros and cons.   Calendar Method One of the most basic ways to track ovulation is by following the Calendar Method.  This method uses a mathematical formula to estimate your day of ovulation based on your cycle length and the first day of your last period.  This method is also known as menstrual cycle charting and is a low cost and low tech solution to tracking ovulation.   Basal Body Temperature Method Another method that you can try is the Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method.  With this method, you must take your temperature at the same time each day (usually in the morning).  Over time, you will be able to spot the sudden rise in temperature around ovulation, and potentially predict when it will rise in the next cycle.       Mira BBT thermometer Track your cycle naturally. Chart your results automatically. Buy now    Ovulation Predictor Kits Ovulation predictor kits are another option for tracking ovulation.  These tests are similar to the pee-on-stick variety of pregnancy tests and are designed to detect the rise or “surge” in LH in your body.  They do not measure the exact day of ovulation, but rather the rise in LH that occurs before ovulation.     Fertility monitors are digital devices that track data about your menstrual cycle.  They have become increasingly popular to predict ovulation and identify an individual’s most fertile days.  There are a variety of different types of fertility monitors ranging from thermometers and armbands to vaginal devices.  Accurate ovulation tracking with Mira One of the most accurate ways to track and predict ovulation is by tracking your hormones directly.  This can be done with an at-home hormone tracking device like Mira.  With Mira, you can track key hormone levels like estrogen (E3G), LH, progesterone (PdG), and FSH in a simple and non-invasive way.  You can get precise daily hormone level readings, similar to those from a lab, and monitor your hormonal map over time through dynamic charts on your smartphone – clearly pinpointing your ovulation patterns.  You can also make use of ovulation calculators that aim to predict ovulation based on the dates of your menstrual cycle that you input.  However, online ovulation calculators are sometimes lacking and the ovulation symptoms can vary strongly from person to person.     Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Ovulation and Fertility: What You Need to Know Ovulation and fertility are inextricably linked.  Your fertility depends on your menstrual cycle and the phases that occur within it.  Knowing when ovulation happens is critical to getting pregnant since your window of opportunity is fairly small each month. There are many factors that affect fertility, but you are most likely to conceive during the six days of your fertile window.  For most people, this begins four to five days before ovulation and ends the day after ovulation. This is because the lifespan of sperm is up to five days and the lifespan of an egg is 12-24 hours after it is released.   Within this fertile window, your chances of becoming pregnant increase as you approach your ovulation day, with your highest chances on the days before and the day of ovulation.  On the other days outside of your fertile window, your chances of conceiving are very low.  That’s why it is so important to be aware of when your fertile window is, so that you can plan to have sex during this time or take precautions if you are TTA.     To maximize your chances of getting pregnant it’s important to have sex with your partner around the time of ovulation, i.e. your fertile window.  Based on research, your chances of conceiving during this time are as follows:   Day 5 Before Ovulation: 1.4-7% chance of conception Day 4 Before Ovulation: 8-17% Day 3 Before Ovulation: 8-23% Day 2 Before Ovulation: 13-29% Day 1 Before Ovulation: 21-24% Day of Ovulation: 8-33% Day 1 After Ovulation: 0.8-11%  Experts recommend having sex with your partner daily or at least every other day during this period of time in order to maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.  This can require a bit of planning and taking time to understand how your hormones work throughout the ovulation process.     One of the best methods for planning for your peak fertility is by testing and tracking your hormone levels.  Using an at-home smart hormone tracker like Mira, you can see your actual hormone concentrations with over 99% accuracy.  The data is then automatically synced with the Mira app, which optimizes the ovulation prediction based on your personal health.  If you’re actively planning a pregnancy, being able to pinpoint your fertile window is crucial to getting pregnant and getting pregnant as fast as possible.     Ovulation Complications and Solutions Some conditions may cause potential issues with ovulation.  Many people have irregular periods and may struggle to predict ovulation, or may not ovulate at all.  Irregular cycles can make traditional methods, like the basal body temperature method, checking cervical mucus, or the calendar method inaccurate.  Ovulation predictor kits (OPK) can be faulty for those with irregular periods and tracking your period alone will not tell you if you’ve ovulated or not.  Using a hormone testing device like Mira is a more effective way to determine your fertile window.  Your daily levels of actual hormone concentrations are measured (with 99% accuracy) to detect when ovulation does (or does not) occur.    If you have a hormonal imbalance, like PCOS, ovulation may not always take place and estrogen and LH levels may not follow predictable patterns.  The hormonal imbalance associated with PCOS can create problems in the ovaries which means they may not release an egg during ovulation like they should.  This makes ovulation testing that much more challenging.   Since your hormones may not follow a predictable path, predicting ovulation can be a challenge for those with PCOS.  To better understand your cycle, you can track your actual hormone concentrations with the help of a digital fertility analyzer.  The Mira device tracks hormone levels and gives you actual LH levels throughout your cycle.  You can see your hormone curve and still see your ovulation even if your baseline LH is high.  This can help you better understand your cycles and the hormone data that Mira provides can be extremely useful for those with PCOS.   Final thoughts Regardless of your goals, ovulation is a key indicator of your fertility and menstrual health.  Keeping track of when ovulation takes place can help you reach your fertility goals.  There are many methods to keep track of the signs and symptoms of ovulation that vary from low to high tech solutions.  Of course, cycles vary from person to person and even month to month.  If you struggle with a hormonal condition like PCOS, you may find it hard to rely on traditional tracking methods.     A better understanding of ovulation will not only give you more insight into your menstrual cycle, but can help you manage your fertility better.  By detecting your most fertile time, you can make informed decisions about your fertility.  Ovulation FAQs    How long does ovulation last?  Ovulation itself is a moment. The time around ovulation lasts approximately 24-36 hours.  This includes the entire process surrounding ovulation, including the LH surge.  However, this time frame can vary among women, and can even vary from cycle to cycle.  Your fertile window also includes the days leading up to ovulation as well as the event itself, and statistically speaking, is when you have the most chance of getting pregnant.          Can you feel when you are ovulating?  Yes. Some people who menstruate experience cramps or mild to moderate pelvic pain during ovulation.  The pain or cramping may occur on one or both sides and is commonly referred to as mittelschmerz (from the German words for “middle” and “pain”).  You may also notice your body producing more discharge.  It’s common for cervical mucus or discharge to appear yellow, white, or cloudy white in color and appear stickier than normal.  This type of discharge is a sign that a developing egg in your ovaries is ripening and preparing for release through ovulation.    What are the signs of not ovulating?  There are different reasons why you may not be ovulating.  Anovulation (no ovulation) means no egg was released so the signs of ovulation may also be absent.  The signs of not ovulating include missed periods, lack of cervical mucus, excessive bleeding during periods, irregular basal body temperature readings, irregular LH test results, and a period that stays light and never gets heavier.      After ovulation, how do I know if I’m pregnant?   Some women may begin to feel signs of pregnancy as early as five days before their expected period, but that may also be from a chemical pregnancy rather than a viable one.  On average you should wait at least two weeks after ovulation to take a pregnancy test or until the first day of your missed period.

Octavia        Read More         Why Track both E3G and LH?              E3G is a metabolite of estrogen. It’s an essential hormone in your body’s fertility. By combining LH             (luteinizing hormone) and E3G readings, you pinpoint your full fertile window and ovulation. E3G and LH are             related to IVF, menopause, and hormone imbalances such as PCOS. By tracking them, you’re getting more out of             your hormone tracking—you’re getting full reproductive health insights.

Medical advisor and partner at Mira. OB/GYN, Reproductive Endocrinology. FACOG                      “The Mira Fertility Tracker offers excellent quality and accurate results at the patient's fingertips.                 As a health provider, I find that Mira’s quantitative measures far outweigh most qualitative                 over-the-counter kits. Mira is far more useful in clinical applications. We utilize Mira with our                 patients to help them successfully monitor, track and succeed in achieving pregnancies.”                  Meir Olcha, MD. Medical advisor and partner at Mira.

FACOG.                      ““As a fertility specialist, I was used to seeing my patients’ hormone results only twice per cycle.                 With Mira, I can see hormone patterns throughout many days of the cycle, over multiple months. This has                 provided clinical insight I have never had access to before, and allows me to tailor treatments in a                 much more individualized way. This personalized approach has helped patients become pregnant at                 significantly higher rates than standard, traditional, and generic fertility protocols.”                  Erin Foran Wolff, MD Partner at Mira.

""From my perspective as a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist, Mira is a game-changing                 tool for patients and clinicians. With the convenience of home urine testing, the quantitative data of a                 laboratory blood test, and an informative and engaging app for hormone tracking—it seems to be the best                 of all worlds to improve the patient experience and optimize treatment outcomes. We are actively                 pursuing approaches to incorporate Mira into fertility treatments to reduce the burden of unnecessary                 blood tests and clinic visits.”                  Gary S.

Yes! With Mira, you can see your actual hormone concentrations. As long as you ovulate, you will be able                 to know when you ovulate—even with irregular cycles.                                    How does Mira work for people with PCOS? Which kit is best for PCOS?                                  Mira is very PCOS-friendly and many women with PCOS prefer it to track their cycles. Unlike traditional                 OPKs, Mira provides you with actual hormone concentration values. With PCOS elevated LH is usually                 common - this means OPKs can give you a false positive all the time.Mira doesn’t use a pre-determined                 average, so you can see your actual hormone levels and curve even if your baseline LH is high (such as                 with PCOS) if you have multiple LH peaks, or irregular ovulation.                                 If you have PCOS, we recommend you to try the                 Mira Super Bundle.                      I'm trying to get pregnant. How can Mira help me?                      People trying to conceive don’t always know when their most fertile days are. Researchers found that                 only 12.7% of people with ovaries know when they ovulate correctly, and only 55% estimated their                 ovulation within their fertile window. Mira tracks key fertility hormones concentrations to give you                 personalized insights and maximizes your chances of conceiving.                      When will Mira Monitor be shipped?                      On average, US, UK, and AU orders will arrive in 3-6 business days. Other countries may take longer.                 Sometimes, the shipping time may take a little longer due to high demand. Please refer to the time on                 the checkout page.

They usually signal the start of your period, but what does it mean when they happen in the middle of your cycle?     In this post, we’ll cover everything you need to know about this special type of cramping, known as “ovulation cramps”. We’ll discuss what they are, what causes them, how to cope with the pain, and when you may need to see a doctor. We’ll also answer some of your most frequently asked questions about ovulation pain and cramping.   What Are Ovulation Cramps? Commonly called “mittelschmerz” from the German words for “middle” and “pain”, ovulation cramps are a type of cramp that occurs around the time of ovulation – i.e. when an egg is released from an ovary.  Although they differ from menstrual cramps, ovulation cramps are perfectly normal. In fact, researchers estimate that approximately 20% of women experience cramping during ovulation. Sometimes it can be easy to confuse ovulation cramping for other health concerns. For example, appendicitis, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts can all cause pain in the pelvic region and lower abdomen – although the pain in these cases is typically more severe.  If you regularly experience abdominal cramping outside of your period, it’s worth tracking your cycle and symptoms. Tools like the Mira App and Analyzer enable you to pinpoint ovulation over the course of several cycles, allowing you to clearly see whether or not your cramps typically align with your day of ovulation.  Does Ovulation Cause Pain? Ovulation is the stage of the menstrual cycle where an egg is released from one of the ovaries. The process itself is not inherently painful and not everyone who experiences ovulation will experience ovulation cramping. However, for some, ovulation can be painful and cause cramping. Cramping during ovulation may feel like an ache, a sharp twinge or pull, or pain on one side of the abdomen, and can also be accompanied by bleeding or spotting. In most cases, the pain is minor to moderate and doesn’t last longer than a couple of days.   What Causes Ovulation Cramps? The exact cause of ovulation cramps is unknown but there are several theories as to why it might occur.  One theory is that as the follicle grows to accommodate a maturing egg, it may stretch the surface of the ovary and cause pain or a pulling feeling. The follicle swells and ruptures to release the egg – and the fluid released, together with the egg, may be a source of cramping during ovulation as they can irritate the inner lining of the abdomen and pelvis.  It’s also important to note that the follicle contains more than just a maturing egg, and as the egg is released, blood and other fluids come with it. Until that fluid is reabsorbed, it can cause inflammation and irritation that is felt as cramping.  Ultimately, the pain is due to how the process of ovulation occurs, and it is understandable to experience some discomfort with the swelling, rupturing, and increased fluid during ovulation.      What Are the Symptoms of Ovulation Cramps? Ovulation cramps differ from menstrual cramps in a few key ways. Aside from how the pain feels, menstrual cramps happen just before or during your period whereas ovulation cramps occur around ovulation. Related: Is Period Flu Real? Causes and Symptoms Explained   Pain or cramping on one side of the abdomen  For some people, the ovaries take turns releasing an egg so that each ovary only releases an egg every other month. In this case, you will likely feel the pain on the side where the ovary is releasing an egg, and the pain can switch from one cycle to the next depending on which ovary is ovulating.     Pain that starts midway through your cycle Assuming there is no variation in your cycle length, ovulation usually occurs two weeks before the start of your period and any pain usually occurs on the day of ovulation or the day after. Of course, if you are tracking your cycle, you can start to predict it and you may notice patterns or symptoms of ovulation and your pain.            Dull, uncomfortable, or sharp pain Pain is a uniquely personal experience and each individual will experience it differently.  Some experience an overall dull and uncomfortable sensation in the abdomen, while others experience a sharp pain, twinge, or pull.  Ovulation pain is commonly described as uneasy pressure or sharp cramps – but should never be severe. Severe pain should never be ignored, and it’s important to consult with your doctor if you feel your pain is stronger than normal.    Factors Affecting the Intensity of Ovulation Cramps We’ve established that it’s perfectly normal to feel some slight pain or discomfort during ovulation. However, there are certain underlying factors that can make ovulation pain more intense. Here are just a few examples to bear in mind.  Hormonal imbalances Hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) play a critical role in helping our reproductive organs function the way that they are supposed to. And when these hormones are out of balance, this can lead to a number of frustrating symptoms – including pain/cramping in the pelvic area that may intensify around the time of ovulation. Other symptoms of hormone imbalance include spotting, missed periods, acne, unwanted hair growth, hair loss, and weight gain.         Previous pelvic infections Sometimes pelvic infections, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, can cause scarring, and this scarring can easily become inflamed when it is exposed to fluid from an ovulating follicle.

Recurring feelings of pain and cramping around the time of ovulation each cycle.  Endometriosis Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) grows on other organs and anatomic structures outside of the uterus. For example, endometrial tissue can implant itself on or around the ovaries and/or the fallopian tubes – which are both involved in ovulation. The presence of this excess tissue can then cause pain during ovulation.  To learn more, check out our article Endometriosis and Ovulation Pain: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments.  Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects ovarian functioning, and in some cases, can cause tiny fluid-filled sacs (follicles) to appear in the ovaries. The presence of these follicles in the ovaries can then cause pain during ovulation.  Trauma and stress Any type of surgery in the abdomen or pelvic area (such as a cesarean section, appendix surgery, or surgery for endometriosis) can leave behind scar tissue. This scar tissue can then become inflamed during ovulation which can be painful.  Additionally, if your body is under stress due to physical or emotional factors, you may also be more susceptible to experiencing pain during ovulation. This is because stress can lead to an imbalance of neurotransmitters, and in turn this can affect the perception of pain.  How to prevent and treat cramping during ovulation It may be impossible to prevent ovulation cramps, as they are a natural byproduct of ovulation and how the process occurs.  However, just because it’s perfectly natural to experience ovulation cramps, that doesn’t mean you have to suffer in silence. Most ovulation pain can be treated with the help of over-the-counter medications and/or home remedies – without the need for medical intervention.  Apply heat When it comes to coping with ovulation cramps, heat will be your best friend! Heat not only helps your muscles relax, but it can also help to promote blood flow and increase circulation. We recommend taking a hot bath or placing a heating pad or water bottle on your abdomen – this can help you get some instant relief from pain due to ovulation.  Take over-the-counter pain relievers Basic over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, or other NSAIDs can help to relieve general pain and swelling during ovulation.     Stay active with gentle exercises and stretches Staying active is a great way to relieve tension, boost happy hormones, and improve your overall sleep quality. It’s also a wonderful way to keep yourself distracted from the discomfort of ovulation!  Although you may not be feeling up for your normal exercise class or gym session, you can still benefit from gentle exercises such as walking, stretching, yoga, and swimming.  Be mindful of your diet The food we eat can have a huge impact on the way we feel. In fact, a balanced diet (one that is rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats) can help balance your hormones and regulate ovulation.  To reduce pain during ovulation, it’s also a good idea to stay away from foods that may cause inflammation. This includes processed foods, fried foods, red meat, trans fats, and foods high in added sugar.  Set aside time for relaxation Sometimes life can get so hectic that we forget to make relaxation a priority – even though the benefits of relaxation are endless! Relaxing not only helps your hormones stay in balance, but it can also improve your sleep.  Everyone’s idea of a relaxing activity is different – we recommend finding something that you enjoy doing and regularly penciling in time with yourself to do it.  Explore herbal remedies, supplements, and alternative therapies Certain herbal remedies and supplements may help with general inflammation, which in turn can help to relieve pain due to ovulation. For example, Healthline mentions that curcumin, chamomile, peppermint, lavender, ginger, ashwagandha, and a combination of cinnamon, clove, rose, and lavender may help to relieve symptoms associated with endometriosis.  Other alternative treatments that may help with pain management during ovulation include breathing techniques, guided meditation, acupuncture, and massage therapy.   Other possible causes for abdominal cramps  Abdominal cramps aren’t always caused by ovulation or menstruation. Sometimes, abdominal pain or cramping may be a sign that something else is going on. For example, abdominal pain and/or cramping is a known symptom of the following:   pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Urinary tract infections Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cysts Endometriosis Uterine fibroids.  Generally speaking, any health issue that is likely to cause irritation or swelling may be the cause of your abdominal pain.  When to see a doctor for ovulation pain Most of the time, ovulation pain isn’t something to worry about. However, you should always trust your gut. Sometimes ovulation pain can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, so if your pain seems unusual or more severe than “ordinary” pain, you should seek treatment. If your pain is accompanied by heavy bleeding, fever, or nausea, this could indicate that something more serious is going on. If this is the case, you should speak with your doctor immediately for further advice.      Use science to get pregnant faster Track all key fertility hormones at once Order Now    Ovulation cramps FAQs What is the duration of ovulation cramps? Depending on the individual, the duration of ovulation cramping can range from a few minutes to a few days around the time of ovulation.  Can ovulation cramps indicate fertility? No. There is no evidence that suggests that ovulation cramping is a sign or indication of “good” fertility.  Are ovulation cramps the same as menstrual cramps? No. While ovulation cramps and menstrual cramps may feel similar, they differ in terms of timing. Ovulation cramps occur around the time of ovulation (midway through your cycle), and menstrual cramps occur ahead of or during your period (which marks the start of your cycle).  Can ovulation cramps be a sign of pregnancy? No. Ovulation cramps are not a sign of pregnancy. However, because ovulation cramping can feel similar to implantation cramping, it is possible to mistake one for the other.  The only way to know for sure if you are pregnant is to take a pregnancy test at the right time, which is no sooner than 12 days past ovulation (12 DPO) or the first day of your next missed period.  Are there any natural remedies for ovulation cramps? Yes, there are certain supplements and treatments you can try that may help to alleviate pain due to ovulation cramping.  Herbal remedies include: curcumin, chamomile, peppermint, lavender, ginger, ashwagandha, and a combination of cinnamon, clove, rose, and lavender.  Other alternative treatments you can try for general pain management include: breathing techniques, guided meditation, acupuncture, and massage therapy.   Can stress make ovulation cramps worse? Yes. Emotional or physical stress can lead to hormone imbalance, which may disrupt ovulation and make ovulation cramping worse.  Is it normal to have severe ovulation pain? No. Severe ovulation pain is not normal. If your pain around ovulation is severe, make an appointment with your healthcare provider for further advice.  Can birth control pills help alleviate ovulation cramps? Yes. Certain birth control pills stop the body from ovulating, which eliminates ovulation pain altogether. If this is a treatment method you are interested in, we recommend speaking with your doctor for the best advice for your individual situation.  Should I be concerned if I experience no ovulation pain? No. Not everyone experiences ovulation pain – and that’s okay! There is no reason to be concerned if you have never experienced or noticed it before.      Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

What Does BBT Have to Do With Fertility? 5 Things BBT Can Tell You About Your Fertility Does BBT Tracking Actually Work? Let’s Look at the Stats  Introducing Our New Product: Basal Body Thermometer Step-By-Step Guide to BBT Monitoring With Mira I’m Pregnant! Do I Still Need to Track BBT?  Deciding if the BBT Method is Right for You Improving Accuracy: Are There Other Fertility Tracking Options Available?     Share             Start Your Fertility Journey      What does temperature, ovulation, and getting pregnant have in common? Turns out – quite a lot!  Intrigued? Read on to learn exactly what your basal body temperature (BBT) is, what it says about your fertility, and how you can benefit from tracking it based on your fertility goals. We’ll also introduce you to the newest member of the Mira family – our Basal Body Thermometer!     What is BBT? Basal Body Temperature or “BBT” for short is a measurement of the body’s temperature when it is completely at rest. BBT thermometers are designed to measure BBT down to a tenth of a degree – which is why they can be used to track very slight changes in body temperature over time.  It’s important to note that BBT is not the same as regular body temperature. BBT can only be measured when the body is at rest. This is why BBT measurements must be taken first thing in the morning after the body has been asleep.  What Does BBT Have to Do With Fertility? A rise in BBT is a sign that ovulation has occurred – here’s why.  At the start of the follicular phase (i.e. day one of your period), estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are low.  Within just a few days (depending on the length of your cycle), estrogen begins to rise gradually. Then, approximately midway through the cycle, LH rapidly increases to trigger ovulation. After ovulation (during the luteal phase), LH returns back to its baseline and estrogen gradually decreases.  Progesterone, on the other hand, rises throughout the first half of the luteal phase before falling again in the week or so before your period begins. This rise in progesterone after ovulation is linked to a noticeable rise in BBT, which lasts for the remainder of the menstrual cycle. This increase is typically around 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or up to 0.3 degrees Celsius). So to put it simply: BBT has a lot to do with fertility! This is because it is one of the many natural symptoms of ovulation.         5 Things BBT Can Tell You About Your Fertility When measured and tracked daily, BBT can tell us a lot about our fertility status – here are five key examples.  Ovulation A slight rise in BBT is a good indicator that ovulation has occurred. This is particularly helpful for individuals looking to better understand their cycles and ability to conceive.  Cycle characteristics BBT tracking can provide you with a full picture of what your “typical” cycle looks like. For example, you can learn how long your cycle typically lasts, at what point within your cycle ovulation usually occurs, and whether or not you experience irregular ovulation.  When to have sex to plan a pregnancy Over time, BBT tracking enables you to see when you are most likely to ovulate. And by estimating your day of ovulation, you can also estimate your fertile window. You can then plan to have sex with your partner during this time in order to maximize your chances of conception.  When not to have sex to avoid pregnancy On the flip side, BBT tracking can also be used as a way to prevent pregnancy. By estimating ovulation and your fertile window, you can proactively avoid having sex during this period of time when the chances of conception are at their highest.  If you are pregnant Elevated BBT levels are also an early symptom of pregnancy. So if your BBT does not go back down around the time of your period, this could be a very early sign that you are pregnant.  Does BBT Tracking Actually Work? Let’s Look at the Stats  In a research study of 30 menstruating women, BBT tracking was 80% effective at estimating ovulation. In another study involving a mobile app, BBT tracking alongside the documentation of cycle dates was found to be over 91% effective at preventing pregnancy.  However, it’s important to note that the effectiveness of BBT tracking depends greatly on the accuracy and consistency of the user. For example, if you miss a date or if you record an incorrect temperature, this can throw off your tracking and reduce effectiveness.  At Mira, we see the process of measuring and tracking BBT as an excellent way to get to know your body better. By familiarizing yourself with the biological markers of fertility (such as BBT), you can make more informed decisions – no matter what your reproductive objectives are.  Introducing Our New Product: Basal Body Thermometer We want you to learn everything you can about your fertility, and that’s why we are SO excited to introduce you to Mira’s own basal body thermometer!  This thermometer is designed to help you measure and track your BBT, so that you can effectively plan (or avoid) pregnancy.  It’s the perfect tool for individuals and couples who are:  Wanting to learn more about their unique menstrual cycle patterns and milestones Thinking about planning a pregnancy now or in the near future Looking for a natural family planning (NFP) method   When used together with the calendar function in the Mira app, this basal body thermometer is the perfect sidekick to help you achieve your fertility goals!      Mira BBT thermometer Track your cycle naturally. Chart your results automatically. Buy now    Step-By-Step Guide to BBT Monitoring With Mira Measuring  Take your thermometer out of the box and find a home for it near your bed – for example, in the drawer of a bedside table.  Each morning right after you wake up, take your thermometer, turn it on, and place it under your tongue for 60 seconds. Your results will then be displayed digitally on the thermometer. For the most accurate results, try to take your BBT at the same time each morning.  Once measurement is complete, rinse off your thermometer, turn it off, and return it back to its place.   Tracking Once your results are displayed, there’s no need to worry about charting them out on a piece of paper. Instead, the Mira BBT thermometer syncs automatically with the Mira app; storing and charting your data for you.  Interpreting the charts It will take several cycles (at least three) before you will start to notice any patterns with your BBT charts.  Once you have at least three cycles’ worth of data, you may start to notice some trends. Here are a few scenarios that may occur:   Your BBT line is consistently low (in the first half of each cycle) and then consistently higher (in the second half of the cycle): This is considered a “normal” BBT chart reading, as it shows that your temperature is elevated after ovulation before returning back to baseline levels at the start of your period.   Your BBT line is consistently flat: If your BBT measurements create a flat line with no clear patterns or any highs or lows, this could indicate that your body is not ovulating.   Your BBT line displays a zigzag shape: If your BBT measurements appear to be all over the place, this could indicate a hormonal imbalance. It could also be a reflection of illness, fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, or inconsistent measuring.         Accurate and consistent BBT measuring can take some time to get used to. If you’re still not getting the hang of it after at least six months, it may be worth exploring other fertility awareness methods. If you are concerned about your results, make an appointment with your doctor and they can provide the best advice for your individual situation.  I’m Pregnant! Do I Still Need to Track BBT?  Once you have confirmed a pregnancy with a pregnancy test, there is no medical need to continue tracking BBT daily. Instead, focus your energy on setting your pregnancy up for success by:  Making sure you’re taking a daily prenatal vitamin with folic acid Stopping the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and potentially harmful foods  Arranging to see your doctor for a health check   You should also be proactive about reducing stress by setting aside plenty of time to relax, rest, and spend time doing activities you enjoy.  Deciding if the BBT Method is Right for You BBT tracking isn’t always a good fit for everyone. For example, the following scenarios can interfere with your body temperature, making it difficult to obtain accurate measurements:   Being emotionally or physically stressed on a regular basis Regularly consuming alcohol, drugs, and certain prescription medication Insomnia, sleeping difficulties, or jet lag Having a fever  Additionally, because BBT tracking must be done at the same time each morning, it may not be a good fit for those who struggle with routine or those who work inconsistent schedules (particularly night shifts).  In unique cases, it’s also possible for ovulation to occur without any noticeable increases or decreases in BBT, which can make the tracking process difficult.   Improving Accuracy: Are There Other Fertility Tracking Options Available?  Yes! BBT monitoring is just one of many tools that you can use to track your fertility.  For example, with Mira’s palm-sized hormone lab, you can measure up to four key fertility hormones from the comfort of your own home with 99% lab-grade accuracy.  From predicting and confirming ovulation to getting a better understanding of how far away you are from menopause, the Mira analyzer empowers you to better understand your body so that you can make confident decisions about your reproductive health.      Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Thanks to powerful AI technology, we now have access to a range of fertility tracking apps that can help us do things like predict our periods, estimate our fertile windows, and make good decisions about our reproductive health.   But with so many apps to choose from, how do we know which one is right for us?   We hope to help you answer that question for yourself by taking a deep dive into nine of the very best ovulation tracker apps in 2023. We’ll also take a quick look at who may need to use an ovulation tracking app, when to use them, and when you should see your doctor.  What is an ovulation tracker app? An ovulation tracker app is an app for your phone or tablet designed to help you keep track of key milestones and characteristics of your menstrual cycle. Its purpose is to help you predict ovulation in order to plan (or avoid) pregnancy.  Typical things that can be recorded in an ovulation tracker app include the dates of your period, basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus characteristics, mood, and sleep. This information is then used to estimate your fertile window and day of ovulation. The app’s accuracy tends to improve over time as it collects more data related to your individual cycle.  Overview of the best ovulation tracker apps for 2023  Mira Fertility & Cycle Tracker  Ovia Fertility & Cycle Tracker Glow Clue Fertility Friend Flo Period Tracker Eve  Natural Cycles  ✅ The Mira App 🏆 Our Top Choice  Price: Free.

Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         What does AMH mean? AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) is a hormone made by small follicles in the ovaries that shows how many eggs a person has left. AMH levels change with age and start rising in adolescence, peak around age 25, then naturally decrease. AMH levels stay consistent throughout the menstrual cycle and can be measured anytime. Remember that the AMH test is not intended to assess egg quality—just quantity. What is the purpose of performing an AMH test? An AMH test can be performed to:  Figure out why someone is not getting their period. Understand why someone may be experiencing early menopause. Estimate the number of eggs a person might have left. Determine the right amount of medication needed for IVF or IUI egg stimulation. Diagnose why someone is having trouble getting pregnant.  What does it mean if my AMH results are low? Low AMH levels may suggest that a person has fewer eggs in their ovaries—which is known as a diminished ovarian reserve. It may also indicate that a person is going through perimenopause.  What does it mean if my AMH results are high? High AMH levels may indicate the presence of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and/or ovarian tumors. Note: Your hormonal level results are not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult with your healthcare provider. How can I test AMH? AMH is a blood test. You have two options to obtain results:   Clinical blood test from a vein, At-home finger-prick test, that is gaining popularity due to their convenience and privacy.  To get your AMH results in 3 days, you can use Mira Panorama Fertility Lab Test (US only). It’s a quick and easy at-home finger-prick test that measures 5 hormones: not only AMH, but also TSH, fT4, Prolactin, and Free Testosterone.  You will get 5 individual and personalized hormone reports with actionable steps to understand what your numbers mean for your ovarian reserve, thyroid function, menstrual cycle, hormonal balance, and fertility health.         Resources Cleveland Clinic.

Why should you perform a TSH test?  What does it mean if my TSH results are low?  What does it mean if my TSH results are high? How can I test TSH?    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         What is TSH? TSH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland, a small structure found at the base of the brain. TSH controls your thyroid gland by telling it to produce two hormones known as T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). These hormones play a role in your body’s metabolism and can also affect your menstrual cycle and fertility indirectly. TRH, the hormone that regulates the production of TSH, can be influenced by cold temperatures and severe stress. Why should you perform a TSH test?    To assess thyroid gland function To evaluate pituitary gland function To diagnose and monitor the treatment of thyroid disorders To determine if thyroid function affects fertility health  What does it mean if my TSH results are low?  If your TSH level is low, it means your thyroid hormones may be too high and needs to be lowered. This is known as hyperthyroidism—which can cause symptoms such as weight loss, rapid heart rate, nervousness, and difficulty getting pregnant. Low result causes:   Primary hyperthyroidism: When the thyroid becomes overactive, TSH levels may lower and thyroid hormone levels (like T4) may rise. This can happen due to conditions like Graves’ disease, thyroid nodules, or thyroid tumors.  Damage to hypothalamus/pituitary gland: If there is damage to the hypothalamus     (a small region at the base of the brain that regulates important bodily functions and hormone release), or pituitary gland (a small gland at the base of the brain that produces and releases hormones, controlling various bodily functions), TSH levels may decrease, which can affect thyroid function.  Excessive thyroid hormone medication: Taking too much thyroid hormone medication can cause the brain to reduce TSH production, leading to low TSH levels.  Severe illness or chronic inflammation: When a person has a severe illness or chronic inflammation, their TSH and thyroid hormone levels may decrease due to non-thyroidal illness syndrome.  Smoking: Smoking can contribute to low TSH levels.  Certain medications/supplements: Certain medications or supplements, like glucocorticoids, dopamine, anti-seizure drugs, and biotin-containing supplements, can cause a false low TSH reading.  What does it mean if my TSH results are high? High TSH levels usually mean your body needs more thyroid hormones. When TSH levels are high, it indicates that your thyroid hormone levels (T3 and T4) are low. This can happen when your thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough hormones, which is called hypothyroidism or an underactive thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism can cause symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, constipation, feeling cold, irregular periods, and difficulties getting pregnant. High result causes:   Hypothyroidism or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. A relatively common cause of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks and gradually destroys the thyroid gland.  Iodine deficiency or excess iodine.  Obesity and overeating. A study found that chronic overeating increased T3 levels over both the short- and long-term (from 3 weeks up to 7 months).  Radiation therapy to the head and neck area.  Toxins, drugs, and supplements. (e.g., lithium therapy, opioids, arsenic, dopamine inhibitors).  TSH levels naturally increase as women age.   Note: Your hormonal level results are not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult with your healthcare provider. How can I test TSH?

What is the purpose of performing an fT4 test?  What does it mean if my fT4 results are low? What does it mean if my fT4 results are high? How can I test fT4? Resources    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         What is fT4?    T4 is a hormone made by the thyroid gland. It is converted into the active form, T3, in different body parts like the liver, kidneys, muscles, and brain. The triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones are important for many bodily functions including metabolism, heart and digestive function, muscle control, brain development, and bone maintenance. What is the purpose of performing an fT4 test?   To check if the thyroid is working properly. To check if the pituitary gland is working properly. To identify symptoms of thyroid problems like weight changes, irregular heartbeats, nervousness, menstrual irregularities, dry skin, muscle pain, and infertility. To monitor T4 levels if taking thyroid hormone replacement therapy.  What does it mean if my fT4 results are low? Hypothyroidism, characterized by low T4 levels, is commonly caused by an underactive thyroid gland. This condition can be attributed to various factors, including autoimmune diseases, insufficient dietary intake of iodine, and certain medications. Individuals with hypothyroidism may experience symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, sensitivity to cold temperatures, and irregular or heavy menstrual periods. Low result causes  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (This condition refers to the underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism caused by an autoimmune process). Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland). Possible thyroid cancer. Pituitary disease ( This condition involves the disruption of pituitary gland function, which plays a role in regulating the thyroid gland).  What does it mean if my fT4 results are high? Elevated T4 or free T4 levels may indicate thyrotoxicosis—which can occur due to various conditions such as hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), thyroid inflammation (thyroiditis), or excessive thyroid medication intake. Thyrotoxicosis speeds up your metabolism—which can be dangerous to your health. Individuals with thyrotoxicosis may exhibit symptoms like weight loss, increased appetite despite eating more, rapid or irregular heartbeat, nervousness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, shaky hands, muscle weakness, excessive sweating, heightened sensitivity to heat, frequent bowel movements, Graves’ disease, thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, or the presence of thyroid nodules (multinodular goiter).

Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         What is prolactin? Prolactin is a hormone that prepares the breast tissue for lactation and milk production. It also affects various body systems—including the reproductive system, behavior, the nervous system, and the immune system. After childbirth, prolactin levels rise while estrogen levels decrease, facilitating milk production. What is the purpose of performing a prolactin test? Testing prolactin levels is crucial for understanding symptoms associated with abnormal prolactin levels. These symptoms may include irregular menstrual cycles, difficulty getting pregnant, breast tenderness, headaches, changes in vision, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, decreased libido, and osteoporosis. What does it mean if my prolactin results are high? Around a third of women in their reproductive age experience irregular periods, which can be attributed to hyperprolactinemia, a condition characterized by elevated prolactin levels despite normal ovarian function. When this happens, a woman might have trouble getting pregnant, her breasts may start producing milk outside of pregnancy (galactorrhea) or they may feel tender throughout the menstrual cycle. No cause is found in about a third of all cases of hyperprolactinemia.   High results causes:  Medications that treat nausea and vomiting.  Pain relievers that contain opioids. Pituitary tumors (prolactinomas) Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) Medicines given for depression, psychosis, and high blood pressure Herbs, including fenugreek, fennel seeds, and red clover  Irritation of the chest wall (from surgical scars, shingles, or even a too-tight bra) Stress or exercise (usually excessive or extreme) Nipple stimulation  What does it mean if my prolactin results are low? Low prolactin levels do not usually cause medical issues, but they may reduce immune responses to some infections. Low result causes Hypopituitarism—a rare condition caused by damage or pressure on the pituitary gland, resulting in a deficiency of one or more of the hormones it produces. It can often cause low prolactin.  Note: Your hormonal level test results are not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult with your healthcare provider. How can I test Prolactin? Prolactin is a blood test. You have two options to obtain results:   Clinical blood test from a vein, At-home finger-prick test, that is gaining popularity due to their convenience and privacy.  To get your Prolactin results, you can use Mira Panorama Fertility Lab Test (US only).

What is the purpose of performing a free testosterone test? What does it mean if my free testosterone results are low? What does it mean if my free testosterone results are high? How can I test Free Testosterone? Resources    Share             Start Your Fertility Journey         What is free testosterone? Testosterone is a hormone that both men and women have in their bodies. Testosterone is also produced in the ovary, adrenal cortex, and placenta during pregnancy. Testosterone is important for many things in women, like keeping their sex drive healthy and strengthening their bones and muscles. Testosterone can also be turned into estrogen, which is the main sex hormone in women. Blood tests for testosterone measure different forms, including free testosterone, which is the active form not bound to other molecules. This test helps diagnose specific medical conditions. What is the purpose of performing a free testosterone test? Testing free testosterone levels can assist in diagnosing symptoms related to hormonal imbalances. In women, testosterone plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy sex drive, promoting bone health, and enhancing bone strength and growth.  What does it mean if my free testosterone results are low? Low levels of testosterone in women can lead to symptoms such as sluggishness, mood swings, muscle weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, lack of concentration, reduced sex drive and sexual satisfaction, weight gain, hair thinning, fertility issues, irregular menstrual cycles, and vaginal dryness. Please note: Low testosterone symptoms in women can be mild and similar to other conditions such as hypothyroidism or iron deficiency anemia. Multiple tests are necessary to distinguish between these conditions. Low results cause:  Testosterone levels naturally decrease as women age, especially after menopause. Medications that manage menopause side effects can lower testosterone levels, such as oral estrogen. Women undergoing ovary removal surgery or chemotherapy may experience low testosterone levels. Eating disorders, like anorexia, can disrupt testosterone production due to a lack of fatty tissue involvement in hormone development. Birth control pills can decrease testosterone levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Adrenal or pituitary gland conditions, like tumors, can reduce testosterone production in women.  What does it mean if my free testosterone results are high? High levels of testosterone in women can be associated with symptoms including irregular or absent periods, excess facial and body hair growth, blood sugar imbalances, difficulty getting pregnant, thinning hair on the scalp, and excessive acne. High results cause:The leading causes of high testosterone levels in women are:    Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A hormonal disorder characterized by elevated levels of androgens, including testosterone. This can result in disrupted ovulation and a range of symptoms such as excessive facial and body hair growth, irregular or absent menstrual cycles, acne, and hair thinning or loss. PCOS can also make it difficult for women to get pregnant.  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A genetic disorder affecting the adrenal glands, located on top of the kidneys, that produce hormones regulating metabolism, the immune system, and other functions. Women with CAH produce excess androgens leading to symptoms similar to those of PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles, increased facial and body hair growth, and infertility.  Thyroid problems. Research has shown that hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive, is indirectly connected to high testosterone levels in women. This is because hypothyroidism can lead to reduced production of the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which is important in balancing sex hormones in the blood. If SHBG levels decrease excessively, it can result in an increase in testosterone levels, leading to associated symptoms.  Insulin resistance happens when the body becomes less responsive to the effects of insulin, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels. This, in turn, can trigger testosterone production in the ovaries, as insulin levels rise and remain unused in the bloodstream.  Cushing syndrome. A condition that can potentially cause high testosterone levels in women. This syndrome leads to the adrenal glands’ overproduction of hormones such as androgens and cortisol, resulting in increased testosterone levels. Additionally, tumors in the adrenal or ovarian glands that produce excess androgens can also lead to high testosterone levels.  Hormone therapies—such as anabolic steroids, testosterone replacement therapy, and DHEA supplementation, can elevate testosterone levels in women.  Note: Your hormonal level results are not a substitute for medical advice. Please consult with your healthcare provider. How can I test Free Testosterone? Free Testosterone is a blood test. You have two options to obtain results:   Clinical blood test from a vein, At-home finger-prick test, that is gaining popularity due to their convenience and privacy.

Testosterone Therapy: Prospects and Concerns Testosterone Therapy and Its Impact on Fertility Managing Fertility: Low Testosterone and Assisted Reproductive Technologies Conclusion: The Future of Testosterone Research and Female Fertility FAQs     Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       Introduction to Testosterone and Female Fertility Testosterone isn’t just a male hormone.  In fact, both men and women have testosterone in their bodies and it is an important part of both male and female fertility.  Long thought to be a detriment to female fertility and egg quality, new research on transgender fertility has shown this may not be the case.  Produced in the ovary, adrenal cortex, and placenta during pregnancy, testosterone is important for many things in women including a healthy sex drive and strengthening bones and muscles.  Testosterone can also be turned into estrogen, the main sex hormone in women.  In this article, we’ll help you understand testosterone’s role in female fertility as well as the clinical and societal impacts of testosterone and hormone therapy in relation to female fertility.  There’s a lot to go over so let’s dive right in. The Biological Impact of Testosterone on Ovulation and Follicle Development When you think of ovulation, testosterone isn’t the first hormone that usually comes to mind.  Ovulation is a reoccuring event and the phase of your menstrual cycle where an egg is released from the ovaries.  Previous lines of thought didn’t give enough credence to the role of androgens, but it turns out that they are necessary for normal ovarian function.  During your menstrual cycle, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) rises and helps to develop an ovarian follicle, which eventually houses an egg.  FSH also helps to initiate the production of estrogen, which supports the further development of the follicle and egg, while also thickening the uterine lining.  Next, luteinizing hormone (LH) surges and triggers the body to ovulate.  The whole process of ovulation involves the egg being released from the follicle and traveling down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. Regardless of when you ovulate, your sex hormones follow a predictable path before ovulation and are one of the most accurate and fundamental signs of ovulation to track.  Mira’s digital fertility analyzer measures the numeric levels of fertility hormones (including LH and FSH) with a urine test allowing you to gain a detailed overview of your entire cycle and see your hormone levels in real time.       Mira Max Starter Kit Includes Fertility MAX Wands (LH+E3G+PdG) Order Now    New research from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry suggests that androgens, especially testosterone, play more of a role than we thought.  Although the study was done on mice, it suggests that male hormones help drive follicle development which ultimately influences ovulation.  Androgens like testosterone are not only increasing follicle growth, but they’re ensuring follicles don’t die as well.  This is promising news for those who produce fewer follicles and have diminished ovarian reserve.   Using testosterone to improve IVF outcomes has had limited results and can be controversial among fertility experts, but this research shows a promising new area to explore for enhancing fertility in those with diminished ovarian reserve.    Factors Influencing Testosterone Levels in Women Testosterone levels in women can be influenced by a number of factors and some people assigned female at birth have higher or lower levels of testosterone than others.  Low levels of testosterone can lead to symptoms such as sluggishness, mood swings, muscle weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, lack of concentration, reduced sex drive and sexual satisfaction, weight gain, hair thinning, fertility issues, irregular menstrual cycles, and vaginal dryness.   There are a number of factors that can influence your testosterone level.  Testosterone levels naturally decrease as women age, especially after menopause.  Medications that manage menopause side effects, like oral estrogen, can also lower testosterone levels.  Other causes of low testosterone include ovary removal surgery, chemotherapy, and even eating disorders, like anorexia.   For those taking testosterone as part of hormone therapy, it is a dose-dependent ovulation suppressant.  This means that if you take your dose as prescribed, it will stop ovulation.  Long thought to be a fertility killer by the medical community, new research out of Boston IVF on trans fertility has shown this is not the case.  Even if you’ve been taking testosterone for a long period of time, this study found no adverse effects from taking testosterone on egg quality and pregnancy outcomes.   Testosterone and Sexual Function in Women There’s a complex relationship between testosterone levels and female sexual function.  Although it plays a role in ovarian reserve, bone strength, and overall health, it’s also part of what drives female desire, sex drive, and sexual function.  In fact, according to the North American Menopause society, a dip in testosterone levels is likely responsible for our declining libido after menopause.  In premenopausal women, androgen deficiencies are much less explored and is an area ripe for more research.     Testosterone supplementation (especially for low libido) is common in men, but more controversial in women given that there has been no research done on the long term effects.  Most women are prescribed testosterone formulations designed for men with dose modification, compounded therapies, or other “off-label” uses.  Testosterone also carries the risk of side effects like acne, and hair growth at the site, but also weight gain, hair loss, oily skin and mood changes just to name a few.  More research is needed to study the potential long term effects of testosterone supplementation in women.

Clinical and Societal Implications Testosterone Therapy: Prospects and Concerns Testosterone therapy in women can be a controversial topic.  It is a common prescription for men, but the success of treatment in women is questionable.  In fact, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved testosterone replacement therapy for women and there are no formulations available with the correct dose for women.  Testosterone therapy is only recommended as treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women.   Testosterone is being increasingly used for hormonal balance in pre and postmenopausal women.  Since androgens play an important role in so many systems and functions, testosterone therapy is usually prescribed for the benefit of sexual well-being, muscle mass, energy, bone health, and brain health.  When used appropriately the risks are minimal, but there are concerns about cardiovascular health and anyone undergoing testosterone therapy should be monitored regularly and have their levels checked.  No robust scientific studies have looked at potential lasting side effects or testosterone’s long-term safety in women but more research is being done in the area. Testosterone therapy has long been used to help with gender transition in transgender men and gender nonbinary individuals.  The guidelines published by the Endocrine Society offer a full discussion of this treatment including the benefits and potential risks.        Testosterone Therapy and Its Impact on Fertility The science behind gender affirming hormonal treatments is quite new and there’s still much to learn, especially when it comes to fertility.  Although testosterone suppresses ovulation, it is not a form of birth control and you can still become pregnant while taking testosterone. Unfortunately we have relatively little data on trans men who have become pregnant and given birth since the number is so small, but there have been some small studies and surveys that indicate prior testosterone use did not affect their chances of becoming pregnant or completing the pregnancy (compared to non-trans women).  This is a good start but there’s much more research needed to include more segments of the population and the long term safety of hormone replacement and its effects on transgender fertility.   Whether you want to avoid pregnancy or are trying to conceive, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider about your fertility options.  Testosterone can cause birth defects which is why it’s important to be monitored and speak with your healthcare provider about your fertility options.    Managing Fertility: Low Testosterone and Assisted Reproductive Technologies As we know, testosterone is essential for many body functions and processes including fertility.  Testosterone therapy has grown in popularity as a way to improve IVF outcomes, especially in those with poor ovarian reserve.  Researchers are still unclear as to exactly how testosterone can lead to fertility problems in women and much more research is needed in the area.    There are both clinical interventions as well as natural ways to encourage testosterone production.  Clinical interventions include hormone therapy to supplement low testosterone levels as well as DHEA supplementation.  DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a precursor hormone that your body can convert to testosterone, although its role isn’t completely understood and more research is needed in the area. Natural ways to encourage testosterone production include lifestyle changes that can have a positive impact on your fertility.  For most people that means maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and keeping your stress levels under control.  Excessive stress can cause cortisol (the stress hormone) levels to rise which has been linked to low testosterone as well.   Conclusion: The Future of Testosterone Research and Female Fertility We are still discovering the role of testosterone in female fertility and there is still much to learn on the effects of hormone therapy on fertility.  Once considered a fertility killer, testosterone actually plays a role in follicle development and release.  We know that the effect of hormone therapy on fertility is potentially reversible, but other factors are less clear.  New research suggests there’s more to androgens than previously thought when it comes to female fertility and has opened new avenues to the future of testosterone research.  Further research is needed to understand the complete role of testosterone and androgens in female fertility and to provide better evidence-based information to healthcare providers and patients alike.          FAQs  Is testosterone therapy recommended for fertility issues in women? Currently, the safety of testosterone therapy in women is under research and being established.  Some studies have found testosterone to have a significant impact on the fertility rate of certain women in IVF cycles, but much more research is needed in this area.  Even though testosterone therapy is common, a global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy in women states “there are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women.”  How does testosterone therapy affect fertility in transgender individuals? Testosterone is a dose-dependent ovulation suppressant.  As long as you are taking your dose as prescribed, it will work to suppress ovulation in a transgender individual.  No harm has been shown to egg quality or reserve and once testosterone therapy is stopped, ovulation should return.  It’s important to note that testosterone is not a form of birth control and you can still get pregnant while taking testosterone.  Testosterone can harm a developing fetus and is not recommended during pregnancy.     Can women with high testosterone levels have fertility issues? High levels of testosterone in women can be associated with symptoms including irregular or absent periods, excess facial and body hair growth, blood sugar imbalances, thinning hair on the scalp, and excessive acne.  Women with high testosterone levels may also have fertility issues such as difficulty getting pregnant.   Are there any risks associated with testosterone therapy in women? Although there are risks associated with any supplementation, those associated with testosterone therapy in women remain uncertain.  It is often prescribed for declining sexual function in postmenopausal women, but there are no international guidelines for the use of testosterone in women.  This practice guideline from the Endocrine Society addresses the use of androgens in women and offers recommendations for therapeutic interventions.      Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

Testing for AMH What is AMH testing used for? Low AMH: What it Means High AMH: What it Means AMH FAQs     Share             Start Your Fertility Journey       When it comes to fertility, there is no shortage of tips, tricks, and tests to help you understand what’s going on with your body.  One test in particular, known as an anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) test, can provide insight into your fertility status and overall reproductive health. Read on to discover everything you need to know about your AMH levels, what they have to say about your overall fertility, and how you can test for AMH from the comfort of your home.  What is AMH?  Produced in reproductive tissues, the anti-mullerian hormone (or AMH) is a protein hormone found in both male and female individuals.  Soon after conception, an embryo starts developing reproductive organs aligned with its genes. Male embryos have higher levels of AMH, which prevents female sex organs from developing. In female embryos, AMH levels are low to allow for reproductive organs to develop. Among ovulating individuals, the role of AMH changes at the start of puberty. At this point, ovarian follicles begin producing AMH, with AMH levels increasing alongside the production of egg cells.  AMH levels can be tested in the blood, and doctors can use AMH testing to estimate egg count and the number of follicles in the ovaries. Thus, your AMH levels are a good indicator of ovarian reserve. All About AMH Levels  While your AMH levels don’t change much throughout your menstrual cycle, they do change as you age. In female individuals, AMH levels rise throughout childhood and peak right before puberty. Throughout an individual’s most fertile years, AMH levels gradually decrease along with ovarian reserve.  As an individual reaches puberty and the reproductive years, egg count and AMH levels begin to drop. After age 25, egg count decreases at a higher rate. Again, at 30 and 35, the loss becomes more rapid until menopause when an individual’s egg count reaches zero. AMH levels also decrease with age alongside egg count, making AMH an important hormone to track if you are trying to conceive.    AMH changes over time  AMH levels are important to monitor over time because they reflect the size of our ovarian reserve – i.e. the number of healthy eggs we have available for fertilization. This is an accurate measure of ovarian function because only healthy, functional follicles produce AMH. Studies show that AMH correlates well with the number of follicles in the ovaries. Even so, AMH levels vary widely between individuals and across different age groups. AMH levels also change over time, though they remain fairly stable throughout most of the menstrual cycle. Among ovulating individuals ages 18-24 with normal AMH levels, this number does not change much from cycle to cycle, though it can fluctuate. Individuals with high AMH levels have been found to have large fluctuations in their AMH measurements over time, while individuals with low AMH have been found to have smaller fluctuations. Because AMH levels are higher in younger individuals, this means that younger individuals may have greater fluctuations in their AMH levels compared to individuals who are older.  The most significant changes in AMH, however, occur with age. Read on to learn more about how AMH levels change as you age — and what that means for your fertility. AMH levels by age We already know that our egg reserves decline as we get older. Correspondingly, research clearly demonstrates that AMH levels decrease steadily with age. One study of over 2,700+ women confirmed that AMH levels were negatively associated with age — and that is just one of many studies we have to support this conclusion. According to research, normal AMH levels for presumably healthy women by age are estimated to be:   Age Median AMH Levels   <25 3.59 ng/mL   25 3.91 ng/mL   26 4.23 ng/mL   27 3.33 ng/mL   28 4.24 ng/mL   29 3.87 ng/mL   30 3.51 ng/mL   31 3.23 ng/mL   32 3.50 ng/mL   33 2.80 ng/mL   34 2.54 ng/mL   35 3.10 ng/mL   36 2.62 ng/mL   37 1.72 ng/mL   38 2.16 ng/mL   39 1.74 ng/mL   40 1.62 ng/mL   41 1.17 ng/mL   42 1.26 ng/mL   43 0.79 ng/mL   >43 0.88 ng/mL   AMH’s role in fertility AMH levels can be used to help individuals determine the best time to start trying for a baby. Not only do AMH levels vary by age, but they also vary widely from person to person. Thus, individuals who already have a low AMH level to start with may want to start trying to conceive as quickly and efficiently as possible.  AMH & ovarian reserve AMH levels are a relatively accurate reflection of ovarian reserve — or the number of healthy eggs you have stored in your ovaries. We already know that the number of healthy eggs decreases with age, most significantly after age 35. Thus, you can reasonably expect that AMH levels will decline with age, too. AMH & infertility Your doctor may want to measure your AMH levels if you are having trouble getting pregnant naturally. An AMH test can help your doctor assess whether or not you might be suffering from diminished ovarian reserve or another condition affecting fertility. A normal AMH level for fertile individuals is 1-4 ng/mL. Levels less than 1 ng/mL or greater than 4 ng/mL might indicate an underlying health condition.  AMH & miscarriages An AMH level of less than 1 ng/mL could be an indicator of fertility issues. Low AMH levels may also increase your risk of having a miscarriage once you are pregnant. One study found that women with an AMH level of 0.4 ng/mL or lower had a higher risk of miscarriage over time. In this study, the most significant increase in risk for pregnant women occurred between six and seven weeks gestation. What is a Good AMH Level for Getting Pregnant? What’s considered a “good” AMH level will vary depending on the individual. However, as a general rule of thumb, anything within the “normal” range (1-4 ng/mL) would be considered a “good” level for getting pregnant.  If you are concerned about your AMH levels and how they relate to your fertility, speak with your doctor and they can provide the best advice for your individual situation.  Testing for AMH At the doctor’s office An AMH blood test is a simple, low-risk procedure. It requires no special preparation (i.e. fasting) and should take less than five minutes at the doctor’s office. As with any blood test, you may feel a slight sting when the needle is inserted and bruising may occur.  At home It is also possible to test your AMH levels from the comfort of your home. This is often cheaper and more convenient than visiting your doctor’s office.  There are a number of different at-home AMH tests to choose from – including Mira’s own Fertility Panorama Lab Test. Mira’s test is unique in that it not only tests for AMH, but it also tests for several other fertility hormones including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Free Thyroxine (fT4), Prolactin, and Free Testosterone.      Expand your view into your hormones Test your 5 most important fertility biomarkers & get 5 personalized reports.

In addition to receiving your numeric hormone results, you’ll also receive a detailed, personalized hormone report with actionable steps and insights into your ovarian reserve, thyroid functioning, menstrual cycle, hormone balance, and overall fertility health.  What is AMH testing used for? AMH tests can give insights into an individual’s current egg count. Test results can also be used by a doctor to predict, assess, and/or diagnose several conditions including:   Early menopause Menopause Amenorrhea Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Ovarian cancer  Testing for AMH is very common when working with a fertility specialist. For example, if your levels are found to be lower than what is considered appropriate for your age group, you will be considered to have a diminished ovarian reserve. Your doctor may recommend egg freezing if you aren’t ready to get pregnant, or, they may suggest other fertility treatments if you are currently trying to conceive. Knowing your AMH levels can help understand your chances of successfully using assisted reproductive technology (ART) for conception. For example, if you have normal levels for your age, there is a higher chance that a larger number of eggs will be retrieved for freezing or IVF. Understanding your AMH levels is only one piece of the puzzle, but it gives you important information to help make your fertility plan. Remember, your AMH levels give you a picture of what your current ovarian reserve looks like. It cannot be used to indicate what it will look like in the future or how quickly the number of eggs available will change. However, it is a great starting point for conversations with your doctor about your fertility plans. Low AMH: What it Means Your AMH levels are a representation of your ovarian reserve. Because AMH levels naturally decrease as you age, your doctor should interpret your results by comparing them to the average numbers for your age group. If your AMH levels are lower than your doctor would expect for your age, it may mean that you have fewer eggs than other women in your age group. This condition — known as diminished ovarian reserve — can create challenges with fertility. High AMH: What it Means You might think that high AMH is a good thing. After all, doesn’t that mean you have more eggs in your ovarian reserve? Not exactly. In some cases, dramatically high AMH levels can indicate a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which causes many follicles to grow on the ovaries. Despite high AMH levels, individuals with PCOS often struggle with infertility. Why? Because although these follicles produce AMH, not all of them can release an egg. This is why a high AMH level is not necessarily associated with a higher ovarian reserve in some cases.  AMH FAQs  Can I get pregnant with low AMH?  It is possible to get pregnant naturally even with low AMH, however, you may need some help from an assisted reproductive technology (ART).  It is possible to get pregnant naturally with low AMH, but it’s less likely. Those who have low AMH are more likely to need fertility treatments to conceive. AMH levels can also be used to gauge your chances of success with treatments such as IVF. If you already have fewer eggs to retrieve for treatments, your chances of successfully using those eggs are lower than if you had a large number of eggs. That being said, every individual is different. For some individuals with low AMH, it’s still possible to get pregnant without any intervention. How can you increase your AMH levels? As of right now, there is no proven way to increase your AMH levels. Some studies suggest that consuming more vitamin D and DHEA, whether through food or supplements, can help raise your AMH levels. However, there is no indication that increasing your AMH levels will actually improve your chances of getting pregnant.  The truth is that there is no way to completely stop your eggs from aging (besides freezing them). However, you can slow down the process through healthy lifestyle choices. Once your eggs are gone, however, there is no way to get them back. Thus, increasing your AMH levels won’t necessarily increase your ovarian reserve or make you more likely to get pregnant. What are the causes of low AMH? Diminished ovarian reserve most often happens with age, but it can occur earlier than expected in some individuals. Here are a few reasons why some may begin to lose eggs at a higher rate in their 20s or 30s:    Genetics. Genes can play a part in how fast your ovarian reserve declines compared to the average population.  Medical conditions. Chronic illnesses such as endometriosis and certain autoimmune disorders can lead to lower ovarian reserve.  Surgery on the ovaries. Surgery on the ovaries for certain reproductive health conditions can occasionally lead to scarring or damage, resulting in diminished ovarian reserve.  Should you get an AMH test? You will likely get an AMH test if you decide to visit a fertility specialist for assistance getting pregnant. Women who are under 35 and have been trying to get pregnant naturally for one year, or women over 35 who have been trying for six months, should see a fertility specialist if they do not have success. Your doctor might also want to test your AMH if you are having symptoms of perimenopause or menopause. AMH levels can be used to predict when you are approaching and/or entering menopause, indicating that you are no longer fertile.      Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.

TSH works by triggering the thyroid gland (a part of the endocrine system) to produce the right amount of thyroid hormones. These hormones then go on to help regulate the growth and function of several bodily systems, including the reproductive system.   In terms of reproductive health, research shows that thyroid hormones influence things like ovulation, egg to fetal development, and miscarriage prevention. However, they must be in balance to keep things functioning properly.  In this article, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the connection between TSH and fertility, including the impact of thyroid dysfunction on reproductive health and how to manage optimal levels. Key Takeaways  TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) helps to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine).  Both T4 and T3 play an essential role in regulating the menstrual cycle and fertility When thyroid hormones are out of balance, this can lead to a number of fertility challenges including anovulation, irregular ovulation, polycystic ovaries, shortened luteal phase, hyperprolactinemia, and early onset perimenopause/menopause. Among individuals with thyroid autoimmunity, research shows an increased prevalence of infertility and pregnancy loss  Understanding TSH and Its Role in Fertility What is TSH? TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is a type of hormone produced by the pituitary gland (a small structure found at the base of the brain). Its primary function is to control the thyroid gland (often referred to as just the “thyroid”) in order to help stimulate the production of the thyroid hormones known as T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine).  According to the Society for Endocrinology, both T4 and T3 are essential for multiple bodily functions including metabolism, digestion, heart function, muscle control, brain development, and bone activity. They also play a key role in regulating the menstrual cycle.      Go to the lab—without actually going Test your 5 essential fertility biomarkers & get 5 personalized reports from home. Try Now    TSH levels and fertility  When thyroid hormones are too high (or too low), the pituitary gland responds accordingly by reducing (or increasing) TSH. This imbalance of hormones can then have an impact on the menstrual cycle and fertility.  Some of the most common fertility challenges related to an imbalance of thyroid hormones include anovulation, irregular ovulation, polycystic ovaries, shortened luteal phase, hyperprolactinemia, and early onset perimenopause/menopause. Why test for TSH? If you have been experiencing irregular menstrual cycles and/or struggling to get pregnant, it may be worth getting your TSH levels tested. A TSH test can be used to assess thyroid functioning, diagnose thyroid disorders, and determine whether or not your thyroid is interfering with your reproductive health.  How can TSH levels be tested? TSH levels can be tested with a simple blood test at your doctor’s office.  Alternatively, you can also test for TSH from the comfort of your home with an at-home test kit – such as Mira’s own Panorama Lab Test. In addition to TSH, Mira’s Panorama Lab Test can also screen for thyroxine (fT4), anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), prolactin, and free testosterone.  Testing for these five hormones at once can provide key insights into your overall fertility, ovarian reserve, thyroid functioning, and more.  The Impact of Thyroid Dysfunction on Fertility Hyperthyroidism When TSH levels are abnormally low, this may indicate that the thyroid is overactive and producing too much thyroid hormone. This is called hyperthyroidism, and it can cause symptoms such as:  Weight loss Irregular heartbeat Irritability and mood swings Tiredness, weakness, and fatigue Difficulty sleeping Enlarged thyroid gland  One of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disorder known as Graves’ disease. This disease, if left untreated, can disrupt the menstrual cycle and lead to irregular periods. This in turn may impact an individual’s ability to get pregnant.  Common treatments for hyperthyroidism include medications (such as thioamides and/or beta-blockers), radiotherapy, and in rare cases surgery.         Hypothyroidism and Fertility When TSH levels are abnormally high, this may indicate that the thyroid is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone. This is called hypothyroidism, and it can cause symptoms such as:  Weight gain Depression Tiredness Muscle aches  When it comes to fertility, low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with the body’s ability to ovulate – making it very difficult to conceive. Research also suggests that women with higher than average TSH levels may also have lower egg quality and quantity compared to women with normal TSH levels, which can also have a negative impact on fertility.  Additionally, low thyroid hormone levels are also associated with a shortened luteal phase (sometimes referred to as luteal phase deficiency). When the luteal phase is too short, it can be difficult for a fertilized egg to successfully implant itself in the uterine lining. This is due in part to progesterone levels not being elevated enough to facilitate the implantation process.  If you think that your progesterone levels may be too low due to a shortened luteal phase, it may be worth tracking your hormones on a more regular basis. This can be done at home with the Mira App and Monitor, which can measure PdG (pregnanediol glucuronide, the urine metabolite of progesterone) levels in urine.  Common treatments for hypothyroidism include taking iodine supplements and thyroid hormone therapy – which may help to reduce the risk of miscarriage in individuals with hypothyroidism and/or autoimmune thyroid disease.  TSH Levels, ART, and IVF Outcomes  Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) We know that having thyroid issues carries an increased risk of infertility, often resulting in the need for some help with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Alongside treatment with ART, thyroid hormone therapy can also help to improve the chances of conception and carrying a pregnancy to term.   However, research is just beginning to dive further into the role that thyroid hormone therapy can play in fertility treatments. For instance, research from the American Thyroid Association suggests that thyroid hormone therapy doesn’t improve pregnancy rates, live birth rates, or preterm birth rates in women using ART to get pregnant. However, it may improve miscarriage rates (relative to women who did not receive thyroid hormone therapy).  Much more research is needed in this area in order to fully determine the impact of thyroid dysfunction on fertility.   In vitro fertilization (IVF) TSH levels are considered one of the key measures of fertility and how an individual may respond to IVF treatment. They are not an absolute indicator, but we do know that thyroid dysfunction is linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes.  So what does the research say? Controversy about TSH thresholds before ART remains, and some studies suggest that cut-off levels are too low which may lead to overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatments. However, a retrospective study found better outcomes of live births when patients undergoing IVF had a certain serum TSH level (≤3 mIU/L) before treatment.   More research in the area is needed and optimal TSH levels before assisted reproductive technologies remain controversial.   Thyroid Autoimmunity and Its Effects on Fertility In some cases, the body produces antibodies that mistakenly attack the thyroid. This is known as thyroid autoimmunity, and it is a frequent cause of thyroid dysfunction prevalent among women of reproductive age.    Because of its potential impact on fertility and pregnancy, this condition has drawn much attention from researchers trying to understand the connection between thyroid autoimmunity and fertility.  Thyroid autoimmunity and infertility Several studies have found an increased prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in those with infertility, and some have even found correlations with other conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis. Research is ongoing and study limitations have impacted results. It is clear though that there is an association between thyroid autoimmunity and decreased fertility.  More research is needed so we can have a better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of thyroid autoimmunity and how it can be treated in order to improve fertility outcomes.   Thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy When it comes to pregnancy, there is a well-documented increased risk of pregnancy loss among individuals with thyroid autoimmunity. In a large, retrospective study, researchers found that there was an independent association between thyroid autoimmunity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This verifies the increased risks of pregnancy-related complications and outcomes in pregnant women with positive thyroid autoantibodies.  If you are planning a pregnancy, this is an important factor to discuss and monitor with your healthcare team, especially if you are already concerned about your thyroid function.    Managing TSH Levels for Optimal Fertility Check-in with your doctor If you are actively trying to plan a pregnancy, it’s a good idea to have your doctor check your thyroid levels with a blood test. This is especially true if you have had thyroid issues at some point in your past. Your doctor will be able to then provide the very best guidance based on your individual situation, medical history, and fertility goals.  Consider your broader hormone health and lifestyle So much about our everyday life can impact our hormone health – and this includes the functioning of our thyroid. Here are just a few different lifestyle tips that can help to keep your hormones balanced naturally.  Make sure to get plenty of sleep Sleep plays a critical role in our body’s ability to regulate its hormones and manage basic bodily functions. Doctors typically recommend that adults get between 7-9 hours of sleep each night.  Watch your stress levels Chronic stress can also lead to long-term hormone imbalance. Yoga, meditation, exercise, and setting aside plenty of time each week to do something you enjoy are all great strategies for keeping stress levels in check.  Maintain a healthy, nutrient-rich diet The foods that we eat can also have a profound impact on our hormones. Diets that are high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats help to fuel the body and regulate blood sugar. They also help us maintain a healthy weight.  Seek help when you need it Planning a pregnancy can feel overwhelming and even isolating at times. If you have concerns about any symptoms or lifestyle changes, or maybe you’re just struggling to cope emotionally, it’s important to reach out to someone you trust! Whether it’s your friends, family members, or a support group, there are people out there ready to listen and help.  Mira’s own fertility coaches can provide expert guidance in the areas of fertility planning, wellness, nutrition, hormone health, and more!      Need fertility guidance from a pro?

Schedule Now    Conclusion: The Significance of Understanding TSH for Fertility Thyroid hormone levels are critical for your reproductive health, and when they are too high or too low, it can make the path to parenthood that much more challenging. Suboptimal levels may cause issues with menstruation, egg quality, and ovulation. And during pregnancy, low levels could impact fetal development.  If you are looking to plan a pregnancy now or in the future, monitoring your thyroid health is especially important. Testing is easy, and early treatment can lead to more successful outcomes. If you have concerns about your thyroid function, or other risk factors like a family history of autoimmune disease, speak to your healthcare provider for treatment options and monitoring. Individual factors like age, history, and lifestyle choices can all factor into TSH levels and fertility, and personalized advice is always best.   FAQs Can thyroid disorders affect male fertility as well? Yes. Research shows that thyroid dysfunction in male individuals may lead to semen abnormalities including reduced semen volume, reduced sperm density, reduced sperm motility, and reduced sperm morphology.  How do I know if I have a thyroid problem? Some of the most common symptoms of thyroid dysfunction include:  Weight fluctuations Irritability, mood swings, and depression Tiredness and fatigue Temperature sensitivity (i.e. frequently feeling too hot or too cold) Difficulty sleeping  The only way to diagnose a thyroid problem is by having your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels tested by your doctor.  How long does it take to resolve thyroid issues? Thyroid issues can take up to a few weeks and even a few months to resolve. The time it takes will depend on the type of thyroid disorder and individual treatment plan.  What should I do if I have infertility due to thyroid issues? If your fertility has been compromised due to thyroid issues, the first step is working with your doctor to get your thyroid under control. An endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in glands and hormones) or even a reproductive endocrinologist can work with you to manage your hormones.  Can subclinical hypothyroidism affect fertility? Although the general opinion is that subclinical hypothyroidism (a mild form of hypothyroidism) may increase difficulties with fertility and pregnancy, the research consensus is less clear.   There is disagreement over TSH level limits, and preliminary research suggests that treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism may improve pregnancy outcomes – but not necessarily fertility.  More research is needed in the area, but if you suspect that subclinical hypothyroidism is affecting your fertility, it’s worth a conversation with your doctor about your treatment options.       Mira’s Editorial Process  All content produced by Mira meets stringent editorial standards, ensuring excellence and accuracy in language and medical precision.
