Developing a new website for Young People’s Trust for the Environment
December 10, 2023

Engagement Details
Overview
Young People’s Trust for the Environment (YPTE) is a charity based in the United Kingdom aiming to provide environmental information, promote eco-literacy to young people and give additional information and teaching materials to adults and teachers. 
YPTE is looking to update their website so that it is easily navigated by a variety of target audiences of different ages as well as move it to a new platform that has support and can be managed in the long term. 
As You Like It (AYLI) will work with YPTE on designing and developing a new website based on their old one while making it more functional. The goal is to achieve a better workflow that will allow easier and faster access to YPTE resources, helping both children and adults to learn about and take action on preserving the environment.

Who are we
AYLI is a Bulgarian company working with international customers. We provide design and development services by creating engaging websites for our customers the way they like it. Our vision is to support our clients through making fully customized websites that are both functional and connect with their target audiences.
Our team is committed to building great projects that serve your needs by understanding our clients’ visions, and maintaining a clear communication line to bring your project to life.

Why we would be a great fit
AYLI will support your need for a fresh new website to host all of your resources and serve your audiences. Our development team will work with you to create a custom web presence that goes beyond generic platforms that use pre-made templates and do not provide any customizations. We will use the existing designs and workflow map as a starting point, leveraging them to create the best version that will connect with your target audiences allowing them to easily navigate and enjoy their experience on your web platform.
The meticulous approach we take to developing and designing customer projects coupled with constant and clear communication would ensure your ideas are brought to life 100% to your liking. 
This project will start a great long partnership between YPTE and our company because we will be available in the future to maintain the website and keep it up to date. We are always looking for long-term partners, rather than one-off projects since those provide the most value for both sides.

Design details
Overview
Our design work is always fully custom because we want to ensure the best possible experience and we will be bringing all that expertise to your project as well. Our expertise with user experience best practices and common design patterns will help people find what they need more easily and quickly.

Initial research and audit        
To start we would audit the existing design and sitemap of the website. The existing branding (logo, most of the pictures) will be preserved and used in the new version of the website and the site’s experience will be improved. 
We will be researching the needs of YPTE’s target audiences by conducting interviews and surveys to meet their expectations and mental models. 
Since the audience consists of very different age groups we will do user testing at the prototype phase to determine how each audience engages and what works best for them.

Design concepts
After we do this initial research and UX analysis of the site, we are going to create two design concepts of the website for the YPTE team to choose from. Doing two concepts lets us explore two different potential directions to find the best alignment with YPTE’s future vision.

New functionality
We will keep the website's information but make it more simply accessible, better structured and we will make sure that the information is presented in a cleaner, less cluttered manner that will avoid future confusion.
AYLI is going to improve the donations section by better communicating with the audience through implementing CTA buttons around the website and producing banners on the Hero section of the page so that the audience notices them from the start. 
The newsletter can be improved by adding a pop up box for subscription to the YPTE’s newsletter as well as adding it as a section on the home page. 

AYLI Recommendations
We recommend including an FAQ section in the footer of the website as well as ask for feedback so that the audience's needs are targeted better and the resources provided are up to date.
We deeply care about following the accessibility standards so we will be following them to ensure easy, smooth and simple annotations. These settings help out numerous people as well as will soon be mandatory to be used.

Final designs and development
Once we agree on the direction, AYLI will continue with the design of the prototype and during the process will make sure that YPTE is satisfied with the results through 2 rounds of iteration. 
When we complete the main design and interactions, AYLI will conduct user testing to determine how the audience responds to the new website and adjust the design according to the results if needed.

Technical details
Our team has worked to ensure that across all modalities we are being future thinking with the way that we approach technical work. We are using the latest technologies on the internet ensuring your website becomes more easy to use, gets faster response times, and would be able to serve all your target audiences. The custom implementation we will do ensures that we achieve the fastest and smoothest experience possible. Another thing that is a result of the way we do technical work is that your CRM will be tailor made exactly to your needs and would be possible to be extended in the future. The deep level of customization allows us for a lot of control in how design will look on the different platforms your website can be used. Security is another detail which should not be overlooked, custom solutions are perfect in that regard too. 

Future-proofing and SEO
We have made sure to stay up to date with the latest practices in the field, which would ensure your website accessibility and design. This would improve conversion significantly. 
The technologies your website will be built with are NextJS, React, TypeScript, Strapi, Firebase, TailwindCSS, and others. We’ve chosen these technologies specifically for their future-focused capabilities, including modularity and scalability while maintaining very fast speeds of your platform and preserving your SEO-optimized experience.

Note: This is an estimated delivery schedule and designed to be flexible based on the feedback and request changes by YPTE throughout the process. We have set the schedule to complete mid-April so that we have enough time for anything unexpected while still meeting a mid-May launch date. 

Additional support 
We’ll provide you with 2 months of additional support for bug fixing and any reasonable changes. A reasonable change is one that would take up to one hour per request and does not drastically alter the existing design and functionality. 

Continuous support (optional)
We can continue maintaining your website over the long term, and implement additional features on request. The price for regular maintenance (bug fixes, small improvements) is £350 per month and would start after the two months of additional support. 

The price for additional feature design and development is to be discussed and scoped on a per feature basis.
